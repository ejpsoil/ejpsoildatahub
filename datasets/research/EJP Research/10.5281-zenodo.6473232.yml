  title: Characterization of the Agroecological Zones of Europe
  abstract: 'This dataset was compiled in the i-SoMPE Project of EJP SOIL in 2021
    and 2022. This dataset contains information to characterize the agroecological
    zones (AEZ) of Europe on 4 spatial levels. The data was calculated by an R project
    available on GitLab (https://gitlab.com/heoi/i-sompe-wp1 and https://gitlab.com/heoi/i-SoMPE-WP1-Agri4Cast)
    using various data on land use, cliamate, soil characteristics and slope. More
    information on the data can be found in the report of the i-SoMPE project. The
    dataset contains the following files: 1 XLSX file with information on all 4 spatial
    levels 4 CSV files with information on 1 of 4 spatial levels 1 XLSX file that
    contains information on the attributes described in the dataset 1 ZIP-Folder with
    a shapefile of the AEZs used in i-SoMPE and described in the dataset'
