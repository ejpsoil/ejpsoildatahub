  title: Characterization of the Agroecological Zones of Europe
  abstract: 'This dataset was compiled in the i-SoMPE Project of EJP SOIL in 2021
    and 2022.


    This dataset contains information to characterize the agroecological zones (AEZ)
    of Europe on 4 spatial levels. The data was calculated by an R project (available
    on Zenodo and GitLab) using publicly available data on land use, climate, soil
    characteristics and slope. More information on the data can be found in the report
    of the i-SoMPE project.


    The dataset contains the following files:




    4 CSV files with information on 1 of 4 spatial levels


    1 CSV file with information on cover crop suitability on one spatial level (L4)


    1 XLSX file that contains information on the attributes described in the dataset


    1 ZIP-Folder with a shapefile of the AEZs used in i-SoMPE and described in the
    dataset'
