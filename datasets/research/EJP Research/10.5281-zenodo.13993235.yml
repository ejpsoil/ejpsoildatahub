  title: SERENA EJPSOIL BE Flanders EROSION SOILLOSS cookbook
  abstract: "The internal EJP SOIL project SERENA contributed to the evaluation of\
    \ soil multifunctionality aiming at providing assessment tools for land planning\
    \ and soil policies at different scales. By co-working with relevant stakeholders,\
    \ the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks to assess\
    \ and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services\
    \ and their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,\
    \ at the regional, national, and European scales.\n\nThe dataset (5m resolution)\
    \ was mainly produced to test the methodology of the SERENA soil erosion cookbook\
    \ of the European SERENA EJP SOIL project. The data was prepared according to\
    \ the methodology of SERENA soil erosion cookbook. The objective of SERENA project\
    \ was to develop methods to calculate and map soil-based ecosystem services and\
    \ soil threats. Soil loss was used as an indicator for soil erosion. For Belgium,\
    \ the application was carried out at regional scale for the Flanders region. To\
    \ create the soil erosion map, RULSE modelling was done according to the SERENA\
    \ cookbook using several publicly available datasets. The following auxiliary\
    \ data was used: K-Factor, Land-Cover Map, Long-term 30 yr averaged monthly rainfall,\_\
    LS-Factor given by Panagos et al. (2015). The dataset will be mostly useful as\
    \ a reference result for actors that want to learn to implement the part of the\
    \ soil erosion cookbook of SERENA dealing with the creation of an erosion map.\
    \ It has limited use as an erosion map for Flanders because a more detailed and\
    \ accurate map exists for Flanders based on regional covariates.\n\nThis dataset\
    \ is originally hosted at DOV (https://www.dov.vlaanderen.be/), for the most up\
    \ to date version of the dataset access the data from the DOV repository through\
    \ the DOV services. The original metdata is accesible through the DOV metadata\
    \ catalog: SERENA EJPSOIL BE Flanders EROSION SOILLOSS cookbook\n\nThe DOV services:\n\
