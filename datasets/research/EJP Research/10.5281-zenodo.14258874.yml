  title: Database of field experiments on the effect of agro-ecological strategies
    on N2O emissions in European arable land
  abstract: The database with a specific focus on conservation agriculture consists
    of 11 field experiments located in 11 sites with mostly loamy soil texture across
    8 European countries, thus covering different European climate zones, from northern
    over western to southern Europe. Among the 11 studies, a total of 3 were in Spain,
    2 in Denmark, and 1 Belgium, Italy, Germany, Finland, Switzerland and the UK,
    respectively. Particularly, among the 11 studies, in 8 no-tillage was applied,
    while in 2 and in 1 conservation tillage minimum tillage was adopted, respectively.
    The duration of soil N2O emission monitoring ranges from 79 to 365 days.The database
    with a specific focus on organic agriculture consists of 11 field experiments,
    from 8 field studies located in sites with mostly silt loamy soil texture across
    7 European countries, thus covering different European climate zones, from northern
    over western to southern Europe. With durations of experiments ranging from 1
    to 36 years, a total of 3 studies were conducted in Denmark, 2 in France and Switzerland,
    and 1 in Austria, Finland and Italy.
