  title: Preparation of a Soil Data Database for Modelling Soil Organic Carbon Stocks
    on Agricultural Soils in Slovakia
  abstract: "Soil organic matter (SOM) is a key component of soil fertility because\
    \ it maintains soil moisture and nutrients in the soil and, depending on the soil\
    \ management, can sequester or emit greenhouse gases. These are the reasons why\
    \ it is necessary to know the current level, but also the development of soil\
    \ organic carbon (SOC) stocks in the future. Predicting the development of SOC\
    \ stocks, it is advisable to use mathematical models. One of the most widely used\
    \ SOC stock development models is the RothC model, which requires a set of soil\
    \ parameters data - the initial value of SOC and the proportion of clay fraction\
    \ in the soil. In Slovakia, a continuously updated database of partial soil monitoring\
    \ (\u010CMS-P) is available, which also contains the data necessary to determine\
    \ the required input data for the RothC model. However, these data are not in\
    \ format required by the RothC model. The contribution describes the process of\
    \ transformation of soil data based on the structure of the \u010CMS-P database\
    \ into a form suitable for use in the process of SOC"
