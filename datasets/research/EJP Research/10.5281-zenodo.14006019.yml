  title: 'SERENA EJP SOIL: Soil water erosion map of Hungary according to the RUSLE
    model'
  abstract: "The internal EJP SOIL project\_SERENA contributed to the evaluation of\
    \ soil multifunctionality aiming at providing assessment tools for land planning\
    \ and soil policies at different scales. By co-working with relevant\_stakeholders,\
    \ the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks to assess\
    \ and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services\
    \ and their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,\
    \ at\_the regional, national, and European scales.\n\nPresent data was prepared\
    \ according to the methodology of SERENA Soil erosion and soil erosion control\
    \ cookbook for the territory of Hungary. The map of soil loss by water erosion\
    \ (soil threat) was based on the RUSLE model. The objective of SERENA project\
    \ was to develop methods to calculate and map soil-based ecosystem services and\
    \ soil threats. Soil loss was used as an indicator for soil erosion (ST). To create\
    \ the soil loss map we used data on yearly precipitation of CARPATCLIM database,\
    \ and AGRI4CAST MARS (R-factor); sand-, silt-, and clay content of DOSoReMI.hu\
    \ database, and SOC map compiled in the framework of SERENA (K-factor); ESDAC\
    \ LS-factor for the EU; ESDAC Cover Management factor for the EU (C-factor); ESDAC\
    \ Support Practices factor for the EU (P-factor)."
