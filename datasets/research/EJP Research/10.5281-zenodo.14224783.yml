  title: D.2.4_ProbeField_Field Measurements Examples Over 5 Case Studies_V1
  abstract: "This dataset comprises pre-processed field spectra, including 132 Bare\
    \ Fiber and 29 SoilPRO\xAE spectra collected from five distinct sites representing\
    \ various applications. The SoilPRO\xAE (SP) apparatus is specifically designed\
    \ to measure the reflectance of undisturbed soil surfaces, with the portable spectrometers\
    \ operating in the 350\u20132500 nm range, integrated into a fixed geometry setup\
    \ with stable tungsten-halogen illumination. Due to the high stability of the\
    \ SoilPRO\xAE apparatus, each spectrum represents the average reflectance from\
    \ three repetitions. Alongside spectral acquisition, several soil surface properties\
    \ were measured, including hydrophobicity, measurement stability relative to the\
    \ Contact Probe and Bare Fiber, and spatial variation across an extensive calibration\
    \ area (1000 m\xB2). The dataset also includes measurements of soil reflectance\
    \ under low solar elevation conditions near the South Pole. Average spectra obtained\
    \ with the SP apparatus for different bare soil surface covers and the comparison\
    \ with spectra obtained with the Bare Fiber are also included."
