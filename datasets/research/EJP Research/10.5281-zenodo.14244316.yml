  title: Creating a dataset on fertilizers and fertilization recommendations
  abstract: "Within the scope of WP3 T 3.2 to determine yield responses to lower fertilization\
    \ rates crop-specific N fertilizer amounts applied or recommended by countries\
    \ for important agricultural crops were needed. In this context, FAOSTAT, Eurostat\
    \ and IFASTAT databases were examined to access N fertilization amounts. These\
    \ databases usually provide nitrogen fertilizer amounts for all agricultural production,\
    \ regardless of crop. In addition, for some countries, fertilizer quantities by\
    \ crop needed were not included (e.g. wheat, maize). For this reason, the national\
    \ coordinator of each partner country of EJP SOIL was contacted to request the\
    \ recommended amounts of N fertilizers for important crops in their country and\
    \ their long-term yield values. 15 European countries (Austria, Germany, Netherlands,\
    \ Belgium, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Hungary, Finland, Spain, Portugal, Poland,\
    \ Latvia, UK and Turkey) provided these data. To estimate yields response to reduced\
    \ fertilization an approach was created and used by bringing together data from\
    \ various sources. The yields estimation was performed for \u201320% reductions\
    \ in N fertilization for selected important crops which are wheat, maize, barley,\
    \ sugarbeet, potato and rapeseed for 38 European countries listed in below excel\
    \ sheet including Switzerland, T\xFCrkiye and UK\_. This approach also draws on\
    \ the previously reviewed LTEs meta-analysis by Hijbeek et al. (2007) (with support\
    \ of SOMMIT Project) and van Grinsven et al. (2022). As a result, considering\
    \ FAOSTAT (2023) yield data, Country N fertilization data, Hijbeek et al. (2017)\
    \ and van Grinsven et al. (2022) changes in yield for a 20% reduction in N fertilization\
    \ rates for important crops were calculated for the Countries. For the rapeseed\
    \ evaluation, FAOSTAT (2001-2022) mean yield data and N recommendation values\
    \ of country datasets were used and the final estimations were calculated using\
    \ Tian et al. (2023) equation. If yield reduction cannot be estimated from the\
    \ above data for other European countries, matching was performed according to\
    \ the pediclimatic zonation described in Toth et al. (2017).\_"
