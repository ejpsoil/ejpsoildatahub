  title: EJP SOIL project, WP6 - Questionnaire for supporting harmonised soil information
    and reporting
  abstract: "This stocktaking activity aims at collecting metadata information on\
    \ the georeferenced soil data available in the EJP-SOIL countries. This stocktaking\
    \ concerns not just the soil data itself, but also auxiliary information needed\
    \ for the soil mapping activity, and the mapping experience hold in our institutions.\
    \ Available doesn\u2019t mean that this information is freely available, but just\
    \ that it exists, with a specific data owner (which can also be different from\
    \ your institution) and a specific sharing policy. The first sheet, named \u201C\
    description of data sources\u201D, is to insert the list of your data sources.\
    \ We have put some Italian examples to help you understanding the kind of information\
    \ to be inserted in this sheet (you can delete them). Basically, it is a list\
    \ of data sources available, either for basic soil data (point data or mapped\
    \ data), and for auxiliary data. Among auxiliary data we are also looking for\
    \ mapped data on soil management. Once the first sheet is compiled, the listed\
    \ data sources will constitute a drop-down list to be used in the compilation\
    \ of the following sheets. The second sheet, named \u201Csoil property_data (SP)\u201D\
    , is for the compilation of the soil property data available in your basic soil\
    \ data sources. It is most probable that more the one data source exists in your\
    \ country, storing soil data properties. Each one of these soil data sources should\
    \ have been described in the first sheet. Then, the soil properties store in each\
    \ soil data source should be inserted in the second sheet. For each soil property\
    \ it is requested to indicate the unit of measure used and the analytical method(s)\
    \ used (can be more then one). In order to help you in the compilation, we have\
    \ listed, in the third \"methods\" sheet, the most commonly used analytical methods,\
    \ but you can add more methods if you adopt different ones. If the data source\
    \ list is a soil map already published, we are asking you to compile the method\
    \ used for mapping. In the fourth sheet, named \u201Csoil management (MG)\u201D\
    , you can list the kind of soil management practices which are available in you\
    \ data sources. We must stress here, that the data sources for soil management\
    \ that we are looking for, are georeferenced data sources. The last 2 sheets are\
    \ the drop-down lists used in the questionnaire and a description of the terms\
    \ used."
