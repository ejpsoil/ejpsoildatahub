  title: Modelling CO2 emissions of cultivated and rewetted peat soils with SWAP-ANIMO
  abstract: This document is deliverable 6 from the INSURE project (Indicators for
    successful carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas mitigation by rewetting cultivated
    peat soils), which is part of the EJP Soil programme. It describes the application
    of the SWAP-ANIMO model to sites with peat soils in three locations in Europe
    (wet river valley (Denmark), coastal peatland (The Netherlands) and broad river
    floodplain (Switzerland)) for which two to three years of measurements of hydrological
    variables and CO2 exchange fluxes were available for some period between 2015
    and 2023. The hydrology, grass growth and CO2 fluxes of these sites were modelled
    with the SWAP-ANIMO model using the available measurement period for model input
    and calibration. Model simulations were used to improve the understanding of the
    hydrological drivers of each site and to obtain estimates of the different pools
    contributing to the measured CO2 fluxes using a period of 10 years (2014-2023).
    Rewetting was considered either by calibration on direct measurements of an actual
    rewetting measure (Denmark, The Netherlands) or extrapolation of the reference
    simulation (Switzerland). Also, the potential impact of climate change on the
    rate of peat oxidation was modelled for these sites for both the reference and
    rewetting measure.
