  title: EJP SensRes bi-directional reflectance of soils
  abstract: "Repository of the database of bi-directional soil spectral reflectance\
    \ measurements and the corresponding physico-chemical variables for soil carbon\
    \ estimation.\_\n\n\n\n\nSoil samples from the chemistry laboratory were prepared\
    \ for the spectral measurements that were carried out using a full-range PSR-3500\
    \ spectrometer in the range 350-2500 nm. The spectral sensor was mounted on a\
    \ robotic arm to perform a regular sampling strategy involving multiple viewing\
    \ angles and different soil water contents.\_\_\n\n\n\n\nThree main datasets were\
    \ compiled, and they are summarized in Table 1 in the related .doc document.\_"
