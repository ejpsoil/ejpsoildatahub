  title: QBS-ar and QBS-ar_BF index toolbox for biodiversity assessment of microarthropods
    community in soil
  abstract: "This toolbox contains a proposal and detailed instructions for the standardization\
    \ of the QBS-ar index procedure. The QBS-ar index (Parisi, 2001; Parisi et al.,\
    \ 2005) is an index aimed at assessing soil-dwelling microarthropod communities\
    \ in relation to their soil adaptation level. The core of QBS-ar index principle\
    \ is: the higher is soil quality, the higher will be the number of microarthropod\
    \ groups well adapted to soil habitats living there. Soil quality here stands\
    \ for good stability, high organic matter content, and good biodiversity level.\
    \ Worth of notice, QBS-ar is not comprehensive of the whole soil biodiversity\
    \ or whole soil quality.\_\n\nFor each sample to be assessed with the QBS-ar method,\
    \ three different samplings are performed 5-10 meters apart (Menta et al., 2018),\
    \ obtaining three subsamples (replicates) that are considered representative of\
    \ an area homogeneous for slope and vegetation. 1-page guidelines for sampling\
    \ and extraction were detailed in file\_\u20181.QBS-ar sampling and extraction\
    \ guidelines.pdf\u2019.\_\n\nThe functional characteristics for soil adaptation\
    \ of microarthropods are the reduction of visual structures as microphthalmia\
    \ or even anophthalmia, the reduction or loss of pigmentation and dehydration\
    \ adaptations (thinner cuticle, shorter setas or chaeta loss), appendage reduction\
    \ (as shorter and/or smaller antennae, legs, furca), miniaturization, streamlined\
    \ body form. Starting from these principles, soil organisms could be divided into\
    \ a discrete set of Biological Forms (BFs, eco-morpho-types) according to their\
    \ morphological adaptation to soil (Menta et al., 2018); in the EXCALIBUR and\
    \ EJP-Minotaur projects, CREA Research Centre for Agriculture and Environment,\
    \ in collaboration with the National QBS-ar working group (D\u2019Avino et al.,\
    \ 2021), recognized no less than 54 different BFs, 16 of which were classified\
    \ as less frequent. Each BF is shortly described and\_ associated with a score,\
    \ the so-called Eco-Morphological Index (EMI), which ranges from 1 to 20 in proportion\
    \ to the increasing degree of the soil adaptation of microarthropods. As reported\
    \ by Parisi et al. (2005), some taxa show only one single EMI value because all\
    \ species belonging to these taxa report the same adaptation level to the soil.\
    \ Other groups show a range of EMIs in relation to the different adaptation levels\
    \ of species to the soil. In general, eu-edaphic forms get EMI = 20, hemi-edaphic\
    \ get an EMI rating proportionate to their degree of soil adaptation, while epedaphic\
    \ (epigean) forms get EMI score = 1 (Menta et al., 2018). In QBS-ar whenever two\
    \ eco-morphological forms are present in the same group, the final score is determined\
    \ by the higher EMI. In other words, the most highly adapted microarthropods belonging\
    \ to a group determine the overall EMI score for that group (Parisi et al 2005).\
    \ This statement is not valid for the QBS-ar_BF proposed here, for which every\
    \ biological form concurs to the calculation of QBS-ar_BF index, regardless of\
    \ whether or not it belongs to the same group (i.e. class or order). Moreover,\
    \ to assess variability between subsamples (replicates) an index based on spectral\
    \ analysis (D\u2019Avino, 2019) is proposed. The file\_\u20182.Sheet for QBS-ar\
    \ record and calculation_v2.xlsx\u2019\_provides the selection of 54 most common\
    \ BFs in European soils and should be used as a template for data registration\
    \ during the microarthropods identification and count at the stereomicroscope.\
    \ As outlined in the \u201CREADME\u201D sheet of the excel file, the user should\
    \ register the abundance of each BF and other sampling-related information, and\
    \ the template will automatically perform a series of calculations and will format\
    \ several output sheets. In particular it calculates: mean abundance of microarthropods\
    \ and relative class of abundance,\_QBS-ar, QBS-ar_BF, variability index community\
    \ based on spectral analysis.\_\n\nOne example of the compilated sheet is reported\
    \ as file\_\u20182a.Filled_template_example_v2.pdf\u2019. The sampling was carried\
    \ out during MINOTAUR project, the example was implemented starting from file\_\
    \u20182. Sheet for QBS-ar record and calculation.xlsx\u2019.\_\n\n\_The file \"\
    2.1.Sheet for QBS-ar record and calculations_v2.1.xlsx\" contains updates to the\
    \ previous version:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the \u2018QBS-ar sheet\u2019 the formulas for\
    \ calculating Density n.m-2, Class n.m-2, Density n.kg-1 and S1 in Pauropoda_20\
    \ have been corrected\n\n\n\n\nIn the \u2018\u201DExport_Subsamples\u201D sheet,\
    \ the formula of Pauropoda_20 has been corrected\n\n\n\n\nIn the \u2018Export_MINOTAUR\u2019\
    \ sheet the formulas for Hymenoptera_AB, Hymenoptera_Number_taxa, Diplopoda_AB\
    \ and Diplopoda_Number_taxa have been corrected\n\n\n\n\nIn the \u2018Codelist\u2019\
    \ sheet, Pest_control_method_Insecticide was added between Main_Pest_control_methods\n\
    \n\n\nThe file \"2.Sheet for QBS-ar record and calculation. vers_3.xlsx\" is the\
    \ latest version of the sheet. It contains several updates regarding the metadata\
    \ that can be entered, updated descriptions of the biological forms and their\
    \ common name. The order of the biological forms has been changed from the previous\
    \ version: Hymenoptera-L_10 has been moved between the rare forms and Symphyla_20\
    \ has been moved between Chilopoda_20 and Pauropoda_20. One example of the compilated\
    \ sheet is reported as file\_\u20182a.Filled_template_example_v3.pdf\u2019.\n\n\
    This file also contains a new printable sheet called \"Data_report\" that automatically\
    \ summarizes the values of the QBS indices, diversity indices (Shannon, Evenness,\
    \ Simpson and Richness) and abundances per square meter of the different biological\
    \ forms along with the graphs.\n\nThe collection, merging and organization of\
    \ data from the precompiled sheet could be a cumbersome task, especially for surveys\
    \ with many different samples. The user would need to copy-paste each row in the\
    \ \u201CExport_Sample\u201D or \u201CExport_Subsample\u201D sheets (from file\
    \ 2.) to a new file, to perform overall analysis; an error-prone operation. To\
    \ ease this process, we have compiled a short R script that can be found in this\
    \ submission as the third file\_\u20183.QBS-ar data merging_v2.R\u2019. By using\
    \ the script, the user would automatically obtain three files (csv and/or xlsx,\
    \ that will be stored in a \u201CResults\u201D folder) resulting from the merging\
    \ of any number of QBS precompiled templates collected in a folder:\_\_\n\n1.\
    \ The result of the merge of \u201CExport_Sample\u201D sheets\_\n\n2. The result\
    \ of the merge of \u201CExport_Subsample\u201D sheets\_\_\n\n3. The result of\
    \ the merge of\_ \"Export_MINOTAUR\" sheets\_\n\nThe latest version of the script\
    \ is \u201C3.QBS-ar data merging_v3.R\u201D\n\nIt is recommended to use this version\
    \ for the file \u201C2.Sheet for QBS-ar record and calculation. vers_3.xlsx\u201D\
