  title: Soil laboratory spectra of agricultural sites in the Czech Republic
  abstract: "The dataset includes VNIR-SWIR spectra of dried, ground, and sieved (<\
    \ 2 mm) soil samples collected from three agricultural sites in the Czech Republic.\
    \ The spectra\_were recorded in the laboratory using an\_ASD FieldSpec 3 instrument\
    \ and under\_the standard protocol.\_The samples were gathered from Klu\u010D\
    ov, Nov\xE1 Ves nad Popelkou, and Udrnice sites (80 samples from each site) in\
    \ June 2021. The dataset also contains sample coordinates and some parameters\
    \ including SOC and texture, prepared and stored in MS Excel (.xlsx) format. The\
    \ data were used in STEROPES WP1 (basic local models development)."
