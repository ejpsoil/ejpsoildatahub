  title: 'EPJSOIL SERENA WP3 T3.3 : France climatic and land use change modelling
    dataset (Saclay)'
  abstract: "The internal EJP SOIL project SERENA contributed to the evaluation of\
    \ soil multifunctionality aiming at providing assessment tools for land planning\
    \ and soil policies at different scales. By co-working with relevant stakeholders,\
    \ the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks to assess\
    \ and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services\
    \ and their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,\
    \ at the regional, national, and European scales. \_\n\nData aims to explore the\
    \ effect of climate change according to different climate scenario up to 2050,\
    \ and to understand the resistance of soil in response to climate change and different\
    \ type of land use. Additionally, it aims to understand the relations between\
    \ SES, and the main factors affecting Soil Ecosystem Services (SES) variations.\
    \ Data has been produced by the SERENA team WP3 T3.3 France using JAVA-STICS 10.0.0\
    \ model and the STICSonR package, using the input files specified in the data.\
    \ Results consit of the yearly data of SES calculated from the daily modeling\
    \ from STICS. Because of the file size of daily results from STICS, such file\
    \ are not part of the dataset. Input data and R scripts used are instead provided.\n\
    \nClimatic data were obtained from SAFRAN climatic data provided by M\xE9t\xE9\
    o-France and were downloaded via the SICLIMA platform developed by AgroClim-INRAE.\
    \ Plants and fertilizers data come from default dataset from STICS. All input\
    \ data are available as part of this dataset."
