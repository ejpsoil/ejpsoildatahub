  title: Soil grid data for 3 agricultural fields in Italy (Soil Moisture, soil organic
    carbon)
  abstract: "Soil data collected in an agricultural area with annual crops in Italy\
    \ (west-central Lombardia Po Valley, province of Pavia). The data refers to soil\
    \ properties of 320 soil samples for Soil Moisture and \_120 for SOC, collected\
    \ in the topsoil (around 5-10 cm), considering a regular sampling grid, within\
    \ three agricultural field with different crops (spring-summer cycle) and soils\
    \ type, Rice-Loamy, Sorghum-Sandy and, Maize-Clay, in a period (before the seeding\
    \ of the crops), \_when the soil was bare, in the framework of the EJP Steropes\
    \ project.\n\nThe aim of the collected dataset was to be able to analyse the influence\
    \ of soil moisture in SOC (WP2 of the STEROPES project) prediction models from\
    \ remote sensing.\n\nData in the form of shape file (one shapefile for each agricultural\
    \ field, for oth Soil Moisture and SOC), and pictures of the soil surface in .jpg\
    \ format.\_"
