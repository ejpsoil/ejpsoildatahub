  title: Field data of soil greenhouse gas fluxes from SOMMIT long-term experiments
  abstract: "This is a database of field data of soil greenhouse gas fluxes and ancillary\
    \ data from long-term experiments (LTEs) that participated in the task 1 of the\
    \ work package 3 from SOMMIT. As of November 2024 (V 1.0) six LTEs have contributed\
    \ with data: \"ACBB Estr\xE9es-Mons, France\", \"Rutzendorf_17, Austria\", \"\
    Maintainance of organic orchards, Italy\", \"Fagna, Italy\", \"ULBF-Ljubljana,\
    \ Slovenia\" and \"Grabow 2, Poland\". All LTEs are referenced according to the\
    \ LTE Index from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7598122. The data includes soil\
    \ greenhouse gas fluxes (N2O, CO2 and CH4) under different management practices,\
    \ as well as ancillary data that might be useful to explain the observed fluxes.\
    \ The database includes metadata on how soil greenhouse flux data and ancillary\
    \ data were collected. Individual soil gas flux estimates are also expressed in\
    \ CO2 equivalents [mg CO2-eq m-2 h-1], thereby providing a dataset on the contribution\
    \ of soil CO2, N2O and CH4 fluxes to the soil global warming potential. This product\
    \ is part of the EJP SOIL internal project SOMMIT, and serves as deliverables\
    \ WP3.2 and WP3.3."
