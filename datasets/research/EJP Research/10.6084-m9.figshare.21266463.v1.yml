  title: "Mathematical techniques to remove moisture effects from visible\u2013near-infrared\u2013\
    shortwave-infrared soil spectra\u2014review"
  abstract: "Visible\u2013near-infrared\u2013shortwave-infrared (VNIR\u2013SWIR) spectroscopy\
    \ is one of the most promising sensing techniques to meet ever-growing demands\
    \ for soil information and data. To ensure the successful application of this\
    \ technique in the field, efficient methods for tackling detrimental moisture\
    \ effects on soil spectra are critical. In this paper, mathematical techniques\
    \ for reducing or removing the effects of soil moisture content (SMC) from spectra\
    \ are reviewed. The reviewed techniques encompass the most common spectral pre-processing\
    \ and algorithms, as well as less frequently reported methods including approaches\
    \ within the remote sensing domain. Examples of studies describing their effectiveness\
    \ in the search for calibration model improvement are provided. Moreover, the\
    \ advantages and disadvantages of the different techniques are summarized. Future\
    \ research including further studies on a wider range of soil types, in-field\
    \ conditions, and systematic experiments considering several SMC levels to enable\
    \ the definition of threshold values for the effectiveness of the discussed methods\
    \ is recommended."
