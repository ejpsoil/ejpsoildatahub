  title: 'Database to: Effectiveness of soil management strategies for mitigation
    of N2O emissions in European arable land: A meta-analysis'
  abstract: "Database to a meta-analysis studing the effects of adding different organic\
    \ matter inputs (crop residues, green manure, livestock manure, slurry, digestate,\
    \ compost or biochar) to soils on N2O emissions. Database consists of over 50\
    \ field experiments conducted in 15 European countries. Diverse arable crops,\
    \ mainly cereals, were cultivated in monoculture or in crop rotations on mineral\
    \ soils. \_Cumulative N2O emissions per unit land area were monitored during periods\
    \ of 30 to 1,070 days in treatments, which received organic matter inputs, alone\
    \ or in combination with mineral N fertiliser; and in controls fertilised with\
    \ mineral N. The original results appeared in 46 articles published between 1993\
    \ and 2022 in peer-reviewed scientific journals, as well as a project report,\
    \ and a PhD thesis."
