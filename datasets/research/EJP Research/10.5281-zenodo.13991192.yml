  title: 'EJPSOIL_SERENA: Maps of Soil Organic Carbon Loss Scenarios in Elva Parish,
    Estonia'
  abstract: "The internal EJP SOIL project SERENA contributed to the evaluation of\
    \ soil multifunctionality aiming at providing assessment tools for land planning\
    \ and soil policies at different scales. By co-working with relevant stakeholders,\
    \ the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks to assess\
    \ and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services\
    \ and their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,\
    \ at the regional, national, and European scales. \_ \_ \_ \_\n\nThe study examined\
    \ the effects of winter cropping systems on long-term soil fertility and their\
    \ potential to mitigate SOC (Soil Organic Carbon) loss compared to bare soil during\
    \ the winter months. It analyzed changes in SOC stocks (0\u201330 cm) at the field\
    \ level in Elva Parish over the period 2020\u20132040, under different land-use\
    \ scenarios. The modeling was based on a SOC stock map layer for Estonian mineral\
    \ arable soils, developed by the Centre of Estonian Rural Research and Knowledge,\
    \ which represented the baseline conditions in 2020. SOC stock projections were\
    \ made using the RothC model, which simulates soil carbon turnover.\_\n\nIn the\
    \ first scenario (Scenario 1), the average SOC stock in Elva Parish by 2040 was\
    \ estimated assuming the land would remain bare, without vegetation, during the\
    \ winter months from October to April. In the second scenario (Scenario 2), the\
    \ SOC stock projection accounted for the presence of winter vegetation, which\
    \ means the soil is covered with vegetation year-round. The dataset includes four\
    \ files: a projected SOC stock map for Elva Parish in 2040 and the stock changes\
    \ from 2020\u20132040 under Scenario 1, along with a projected SOC stock map for\
    \ 2040 and the stock changes from 2020\u20132040 under Scenario 2.\_"
