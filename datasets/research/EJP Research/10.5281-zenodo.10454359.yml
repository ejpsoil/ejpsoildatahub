  title: Trend for Soil CO2 Efflux in Grassland and Forest Land in Relation with Meteorological
    Conditions and Root Parameters
  abstract: "The key process in understanding carbon dynamics under different ecosystems\
    \ is quantifying soil CO2\_efflux. However, this process can change annually as\
    \ it depends on environmental variables. The results of this paper present the\
    \ effects of root network, soil temperature, and volumetric water content on soil\
    \ CO2\_efflux, which were investigated on\_Retisol\_of two types of land uses\
    \ in Western Lithuania in 2017\u20132019: forest and grassland. It was determined\
    \ that the average soil CO2\_efflux in the grassland was 32% higher than in the\
    \ forest land. The CO2\_efflux, average across land uses, tended to increase in\
    \ the following order: 2017 < 2018 < 2019. Dry weather conditions with high temperatures\
    \ during the vegetation period governed the soil CO2\_efflux increase by 14%.\
    \ Soil temperature (up to 20 \xB0C) and volumetric water content (up to 23\u2013\
    25%) had a positive effect on the soil CO2\_efflux increase on\_Retisol. We established\
    \ that the root\u2019s activity plays one of the main roles in the CO2\_production\
    \ rate\u2014in both land uses, the soil CO2 efflux was influenced by the root\
    \ length density and the root volume.\n\nNotes\n\nThis research was partly developed\
    \ in the framework of the European Joint Program for SOIL \u201CTowards climate\
    \ smart sustainable management of agricultural soils\u201D (EJP SOIL) funded by\
    \ the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant Agreement\
    \ N 862695).\n\nThis work was partly supported by the research program \u201C\
    Productivity and sustainability of agricultural and forest soils\u201D implemented\
    \ by the Lithuanian Research Center for Agriculture and Forestry."
