  abstract: "Two agricultural areas, Dalaman and Kocas , were chosen in T\xFCrkiye\
    \ regarding their different climatic conditions, soil characteristics, SOC content,\
    \ soil and crop management.\n\nDalaman site is located in the south-western part\
    \ of T\xFCrkiye near the Aegean Sea in alluvial deposits. The climate of the region\
    \ is classified as Hot-summer Mediterranean climate\_(Csa) with an annual precipitation\
    \ of 1030\_mm and mean temperature of 18.1\_\xB0C (mean values over the 30\_years\
    \ period). Common soil type in the study area is Calcaric\_Fluvisols\_(Drainic).\
    \ In the sampling area both\_corn\_(Zea mays L.)\_-wheat (Triticum aestivum\_\
    L.) or wheat-\_sunflower\_(Helianthus annuus L.) crops are raised in the same\
    \ year.\n\nKocas study area is located in the alluvial deposits of the Konya Closed\
    \ Basin, 30 km southeast of Salt Lake (Tuz G\xF6l\xFC). The climate is classified\
    \ as a Cold semi-arid climate (Bsk) with an average annual precipitation of 362\
    \ mm and temperature of 12.2 \xB0C (mean values over the 30 years period). The\
