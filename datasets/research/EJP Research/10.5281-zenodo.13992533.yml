  title: SERENA EJPSOIL IE WEXFORD SOIL SEALING
  abstract: 'The internal EJP SOIL project SERENA contributed to the evaluation of
    soil multifunctionality aiming at providing assessment tools for land planning
    and soil policies at different scales. By co-working with relevant stakeholders,
    the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks to assess
    and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services
    and their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,
    at the regional, national, and European scales.


    We conducted an analysis using the Level 1 version of the soil-sealing cookbook
    on Sentinel 2 tiles 29UPU and 29UPT, with a reference year of 2019. For this analysis,
    we used National Orthophotos and Google Satellite images to confirm/deny potential
    changes in soil sealing identified by cookbook methodology. The 2018 Copernicus
    Land Monitoring Service High Resolution Layer Imperviousness served as the baseline
    for soil sealing.'
