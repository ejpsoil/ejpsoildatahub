  title: SERENA EJPSOIL PL EROSION SOIL LOSS
  abstract: "General description of SERENA\n\nThe internal EJP SOIL project SERENA\
    \ contributed to the evaluation of soil multifunctionality aiming at providing\
    \ assessment tools for land planning and soil policies at different scales. By\
    \ co-working with relevant stakeholders, the project provided co-developed indicators\
    \ and associated cookbooks to assess and map them, to report both on soil degradation,\
    \ soil-based ecosystem services and their bundles, under actual conditions and\
    \ for climate and land-use changes, at the regional, national, and European scales.\n\
    \nFiles description\n\nData was prepared as a result of SERENA EJP SOIL. The attached\
    \ files are a part of the analysis of Assessment of Soil Threats and Ecosystem\
    \ Services from each MS with the harmonized procedures. SERENA deliverable 3.3\
    \ (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13991087). The RUSLE method was used to prepare\
    \ the attached files. All attached GeoTIFFs were described below:\n\nSERENA_EJPSOIL_PL_EROSION__K_factor_2018.tif\n\
