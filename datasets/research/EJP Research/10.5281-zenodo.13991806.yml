  title: Maps for Soil loss by water from climate change scenarios for Austria
  abstract: 'The internal EJP SOIL project SERENA contributed to the evaluation of
    soil multifunctionality aiming at providing assessment tools for land planning
    and soil policies at different scales. By co-working with relevant stakeholders,
    the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks to assess
    and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services
    and their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,
    at the regional, national, and European scales.


    This dataset contains the change of modelled annual soil loss rates for changing
    R-factor according to RCP4.5 and RPC8.5 climate scenarios, relative to modelled
    soil loss in the base scenario, using R-factor calculated for the 1990-2021 period.
    For each climate scenario, four periods were considered: 1991-2020, 2021-2040,
    2041-2060 and 2061-2080. The RUSLE-based soil loss calculations were done according
    to the SERENA/EJP-Soil soil erosion cookbook and are described in the respective
    project deliverables D3.3 and D3.4.'
