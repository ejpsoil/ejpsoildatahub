  title: PSS_cost_accuracy_calculator
  abstract: This worksheet aims to perform a cost/benefit analysis of Proximal Soil
    Sensing (PSS), relevant to WP4 EJP Soil Probefield Task 4.3. After an explanation
    in the READ_ME sheet, two equations, 'EQ1' and 'EQ2,' are implemented. EQ1 focuses
    on PSS point measurements (i.e spectroscopy), while EQ2 integrates Point measurement
    with on-the-go sensors for the production of Digital Soil Mapping. EQ1 is based
    on the cost-effectiveness index (E), a method proposed by Li et al. (2021), which
    enables a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis compared to standard soil analysis
    by considering factors such as accuracy, time, and cost. In the EQ2 sheet, the
    cost calculation is based on a simple summation, while accuracy is evaluated by
    the relative increase in accuracy (RI) as a reduction in RMSE. Simple interpolation
    methods, such as Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) and Ordinary Kriging (OK), serve
    as the baseline from which RI begins.
