  title: Map of soil organic carbon loss of mineral soils in Estonia
  abstract: "The internal EJP SOIL project SERENA contributed to the evaluation of\
    \ soil multifunctionality aiming at providing assessment tools for land planning\
    \ and soil policies at different scales. By co-working with relevant stakeholders,\
    \ the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks to assess\
    \ and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services\
    \ and their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,\
    \ at the regional, national, and European scales.\n\nThe map was generated to\
    \ evaluate soil organic carbon (SOC) loss in Estonian agricultural soils. It is\
    \ directly related to SERENA project WP3, T3.2, D3.3 with the aim of applying\
    \ cookbooks to assess soil threats or ecosystem services. This map is the outcome\
    \ of applying a cookbook developed by ISRIC (Genova, G., Poggio, L., Kempen, B.,\
    \ & Colman, B. DSM Workflow Seedling. ISRIC - World Soil Information. https://doi.org/10.17027/ISRIC-FSX2-2691).\n\
    \nThe generated map of SOC loss expressed as absolute sequestration rate (t C\
    \ ha-1 a-1) between 2015 and 2021 is in GEOTIFF format at the resolution of 100m.\
    \ The input data for the cookbook was from the PANDA database, which contains\
    \ regular soil monitoring and voluntary soil sampling data by farmers in Estonia.\
    \ To achieve the aim for accounting SOC loss in agricultural soils temporal pairs\
    \ were selected resulting in 1037 paired points where the interval between second\
    \ sampling was more than 5 years. SOC stocks were calculated for the depth of\
    \ 20 cm using the equation by Adams (1973) to calculate soil bulk density. The\
    \ calculated SOC stock for time0 and time2 (> 5 years resampled locations) were\
    \ used as input points for digital soil mapping, that is the ISRIC cookbook.\_"
