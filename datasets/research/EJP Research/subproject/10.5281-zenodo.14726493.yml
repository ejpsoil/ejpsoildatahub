  abstract: "This data set was used for the trade-off analysis described in Anjum\
    \ et al. (2025). It consists mainly of model-based changes in: yields, soil organic\
    \ carbon (SOC) stocks, nitrous oxide emissions (N2O) and nitrate leaching (NO3)\
    \ in response to a generic 20 % reduction in mineral nitrogen (N) fertilization\
    \ for the entire European Union plus Switzerland and the UK. As spatial units\
    \ we used all NUTS2 regions in which the six main crops wheat, maize, barley,\
    \ rapeseed, potato and sugar beet were grown (1059 out of 2400 NUTS2 regions).\_\
    Environmental data are included which were used for additional analysis (hierarchical\
    \ clustering and random forest modelling) as described in Anjum et al. (2025).\_\
    \n\nTo estimate the response of crop yields to a 20 % reduction in mineral N fertilization,\
    \ an approach was used based on previously published equations and data sets (Madenoglu\
    \ et al. 2024). This is the only data set that has a national, spatial resolution.\
    \ Changes in SOC stocks of topsoils (0-30 cm) were estimated at the European-scale\
    \ with the SOC model RothC (Pape 2024). Responses of N2O emissions and NO3 leaching\
    \ to reductions in N fertilization were estimated using the N flow model MITERRA-Europe\
    \ (Lesschen et al. 2025).\n\nPlease note that these modelled data are based mostly\
    \ on national statistics and therefore results at crop- and NUTS2-levels are uncertain\
    \ and should not be used for very specific studies. Please also note the special\
    \ units for crop residues and organic matter inputs where UAA refers to utilized\
    \ agricultural area. Furthermore, changes in SOC stocks are averages for 30 years.\_\
