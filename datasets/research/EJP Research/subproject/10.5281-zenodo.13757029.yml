  abstract: "A dataset composed of 470 soil laboratory spectral data has been aligned\
    \ using the white Lucky Bay sands as internal soil standard (ISS). Soil samples\
    \ were collected in Sweden by SLU, in Italy by CNR, in France by INRAE and in\
    \ Poland by IUNG, and the spectra were acquired in the lab on dry samples. Each\
    \ partners scanned the ISS using the same instrument as the soil samples, this\
    \ allowed to compute the correction factor for each instrument.\n\nAlong with\
    \ the main dataset, an explanation document and a R script are provided-\n\nThe\
    \ R script can be used to align spectral data acquired by using different nstruments.\
    \ Within the provided file \"CF_lb\" you can find 5 correction factors for 5 instruments:\
    \ The correction factors were computed using the Lucky bay spectra scanned by\
    \ each\_of the 5 instrument (ISS) and the master lucky bay spectrum acquired in\
    \ the CSIRO lab.\_"
