  abstract: "Fungus-growing termites (subfamily Macrotermitinae) have a distinct\n\
    \ geographical distribution, found only in the old-world tropics. Where\n present,\
    \ they are considered to be major contributors and regulators of\n decomposition,\
    \ with consumption rates often greater than other termite\n groups. This study\
    \ sought to understand the relative roles of termite\n distribution (specifically\
    \ the presence or absence of fungus-growing\n termites) and climatic variables\
    \ (mean annual temperature, mean annual\n precipitation and mean annual aridity)\
    \ on global patterns in deadwood\n decay. To answer this question, we added new\
    \ salient data to an existing\n dataset on global wood decay by Zanne et al. (2022)\
    \ available\n at\_https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19920416.v1. We filtered\n\
    \ the data to only include sites where termites were present and thus\n analysed\
    \ a dataset containing 102 sites across 16 countries. We found that\n termite-driven\
    \ decay of deadwood increased with aridity but was higher in\n sites with fungus-growing\
    \ termites than sites without fungus-growing\n termites. Our results also showed\
    \ that the relative role of fungus-growing\n termites increased with aridity,\
    \ as rates of wood-discovery by termites\n increased with aridity but only in\
    \ sites where fungus-growing termites\n were present. Our findings indicate that\
    \ the inclusion of biogeographical\n differences in termite distribution could\
    \ potentially alter global\n estimates of deadwood turnover. This repository contains\
    \ new datasets on\n termite-driven deadwood decay of Pinus radiata wood blocks\
    \ and code used\n for all data analyses and production of figures."
