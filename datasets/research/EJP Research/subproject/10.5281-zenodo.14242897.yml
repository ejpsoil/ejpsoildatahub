  abstract: "The root shoot database is a collection of literature data gathered over\
    \ the space of a year covering studies up until the end of 2022. The primary driver\
    \ for the development of the root shoot database was to provide root and shoot\
    \ estimates for key European crops. The specific criteria for a study to be included\
    \ in the data base are the following:\n\nOverall criteria for a study to qualify:\n\
    \n1)\_\_\_\_\_ Contain root and shoot estimates and/or RS ratios\n\n2)\_\_\_\_\
    \_ Originate from annual and perennial crops grown in Europe (according to list\
    \ of countries defined by EJP Soil)\n\n3)\_\_\_\_\_ Include a minimum of necessary\
    \ meta-data\n\n4)\_\_\_\_\_ Originates from field studies (i.e. pot studies were\
    \ excluded because of artificial effects on roots)\n\nDuring the initial literature\
    \ survey, a range of existing databases were assessed to identify suitable articles\
    \ for inclusion in this analysis. This included existing data collections, data\
    \ from partners and literature review:\n\n\u2022\_\_\_\_\_\_ Data from Martin\
    \ Bolinder\u2019s (SLU) collection\n\n\u2022\_\_\_\_\_\_ Data from several project\
    \ partners (From France, Denmark, Portugal, Switzerland)\n\n\u2022\_\_\_\_\_\_\
    \ GrooT and TRY database screening\n\nIn addition to gathering data from published\
    \ articles, where appropriate, contact was made with corresponding authors to\
    \ resolve uncertainties and fill gaps in the associated meta data. This resulted\
    \ in a library of assessments for each country and entries in the RS database.\
    \ In total we identified 23 studies resulting in 451 individual measurements across\
    \ 11 countries in Europe (including the UK)."
