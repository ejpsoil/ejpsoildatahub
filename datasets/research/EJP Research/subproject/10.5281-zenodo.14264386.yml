  abstract: "The soil microbial response to changes in temperature and weather patterns\
    \ was assessed in phytotron, with central-eastern Po Valley (Bologna province)\
    \ in northern Italy as a point of reference. Prolonged soil drought (20% field\
    \ capacity FC), prolonged wet (above FC) and moderate drought (commonly occurring\
    \ at 50% FC) were simulated at two spring temperatures, which were approximately\
    \ + 2\xB0C and -2\xB0C colder and warmer compared to average temperatures in the\
    \ central-eastern Po Valley.\_ The response of total fungi, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota\
    \ was quantified using 18S gene copy numbers and digital PCR, that of total bacteria\
    \ using 16S gene copy numbers and Real Time PCR.The experimental setting of each\
    \ of the two cycles (cold and warm spring) consisted of a total of 30 pots for\
    \ a 60-day growing period, after a pre-period of 15 days during which pots, after\
    \ wheat sown, were maintained at the same temperature and soil water content (22\
    \ \xB0C and 50% field capacity) in order to guarantee that seedlings reached the\
    \ two-leaf stage.The soil\_ used for the in-pot trial was a loam-silty soil classified\
    \ as Udifluventic Haplustepts fine silty, mixed mesifocusing collected from a\
    \ ploughed soil.\_ Soil samples for the quantification of microbial populations\
    \ were collected at the end of the 60-day cicles on the rhizo-head of wheat plants."
