  title: Soil grid data for 4 agricultural fields in PT (ECe; soil organic carbon,
    pH)
  abstract: "Soil data collected in an agricultural area with annual crops in Portugal\
    \ (Lez\xEDria Grande). The data refers to soil properties of 63 soil samples collected\
    \ at a depth of 0-20 cm, considering a regular sampling grid, in four fields with\
    \ varying soil salinity (field areas between 2 and 34 ha). The samples were collected\
    \ at a period when the soil was bare, following the harvest of the annual crops,\
    \ and pictures of the soil surface were taken for eventual correction of corresponding\
    \ remote sensing imaging. The data includes: soil organic carbon (SOC) (Walkley-Black\
    \ method), soil water content, electric conductivity of the saturated soil paste\
    \ (ECe), EC1:5, and \_pH1:5.\_\nThe data may be representative of the soil conditions\
    \ of the area, which is a highly productive agricultural low land, prone to the\
    \ development of soil salinity as a result of the rise of saline groundwater and/or\
    \ irrigation. The data can be used to establish relations between soil salinity\
    \ (ECe) and other soil properties as well as build prediction models of the soil\
    \ properties from remote sensing namely, for developing models for SOC prediction\
    \ under the STEROPES project (WP5 (WP5-T3) and WP2 (WP2-T3)).The aim of the collected\
    \ dataset was to be able to analyze the influence of soil salinity in SOC prediction\
    \ from remote sensing.\nData in the form of MS Excel files (xlsx), pictures of\
    \ the soil surface in jpg. format.\_"
