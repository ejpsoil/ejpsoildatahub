  title: SERENA EJPSOIL BE Flanders SOCLOSS SOC 0-20cm cookbook
  abstract: "The internal EJP SOIL project SERENA contributed to the evaluation of\
    \ soil multifunctionality aiming at providing assessment tools for land planning\
    \ and soil policies at different scales. By co-working with relevant\_stakeholders,\
    \ the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks to assess\
    \ and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services\
    \ and their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,\
    \ at\_the regional, national, and European scales.\n\nThis SERENA dataset (100\
    \ m resolution) of soil orgnanic carbon concentration (0-20 cm soil layer) for\
    \ Flanders was mainly produced to test the methodology of the SERENA SOC LOSS\
    \ cookbook of the European SERENA EJP SOIL project. The data was prepared according\
    \ to the methodology of SERENA SOC LOSS cookbook. The objective of SERENA project\
    \ was to develop methods to calculate and map soil-based ecosystem services and\
    \ soil threats. Soil organic carbon concentration was used as an indicator for\
    \ soil organic carbon loss (ST). The map was based on digital soil mapping according\
    \ to the method used in the EJP SOIL project WP6: Digital soil mapping approach\
    \ with random forest using ISRIC workflow seedling. To create the soil organic\
    \ carbon concentration map, we used soil organic carbon data of the regional soil\
    \ organic carbon monitoring network Cmon in Flanders (0-10 and 10-30 cm soil layer)\
    \ from the period 2021-2024. The soil organic carbon concentration of the 0-20\
    \ cm was derived from the 0-10 and 10-30 cm Cmon data. The following auxiliary\
    \ data was used: Digitale bodemkaart van het Vlaams Gewest: bodemtypes; Regional\
    \ climate data; Landgebruik - Vlaanderen - toestand 2022; Tertiair geologische\
    \ kaart (1/50.000); Bodembedekkingskaart (BBK), 1m resolutie, opname 2021; WRB\
    \ Soil Units 40k: Bodemkaart van het Vlaamse Gewest volgens het internationale\
    \ bodemclassificatiesysteem World Reference Base op schaal 1:40.000; Digitaal\
    \ Hoogtemodel Vlaanderen II, DSM, raster, 1 m. The dataset will be mostly useful\
    \ as a reference result for actors that want to learn to implement the part of\
    \ the soil organic carbon loss cookbook of SERENA dealing with the creation of\
    \ a SOC concentration map. It can have limited use as an interim SOC concentration\
    \ map for Flanders until a better map becomes available using an optimised methodology\
    \ and/or new data from the regional soil organic carbon monitoring network that\
    \ was not yet available when this map was created.\n\nThis dataset is originally\
    \ hosted at DOV (https://www.dov.vlaanderen.be/), for the most up to date version\
    \ of the dataset access the data from the DOV repository through the DOV services.\
    \ The original metdata is accesible through the DOV metadata catalog: SERENA EJPSOIL\
    \ BE Flanders SOC 0-20cm cookbook.\n\nThe DOV services:\n\n\n\nWMS ( OGC:WMS-1.3.0-http-get-map\
