  title: SERENA EJPSOIL IE EROSION SOIL LOSS
  abstract: "The internal EJP SOIL project\_SERENA contributed to the evaluation of\
    \ soil multifunctionality aiming\_at providing assessment tools for land planning\
    \ and soil policies at different scales. By co-working\_with relevant\_stakeholders,\
    \ the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks\_to assess\
    \ and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services\
    \ and\_their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,\
    \ at\_the regional,\_national, and European scales.\n\nThe dataset corresponds\
    \ to a map of potential soil loss (Mg/ha/yr) due to erosion risk. The map is the\
    \ result of applying the Erosion cookbook developed in SERENA/EJP-Soil. The map\
    \ is created by calculating the erosion factor by the RUSLE model.\_\n\nFurther\
    \ research into the P-factor and R-factor values is necessary to produce a more\
    \ reliable erosion map for Ireland. This would enhance the accuracy of soil erosion\
    \ assessments and support more effective soil conservation strategies."
