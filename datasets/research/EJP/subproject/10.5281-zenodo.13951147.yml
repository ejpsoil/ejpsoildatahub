  abstract: "The internal EJP SOIL project SERENA contributed to the evaluation of\
    \ soil multifunctionality aiming at providing assessment tools for land planning\
    \ and soil policies at different scales. By co-working with relevant stakeholders,\
    \ the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks to assess\
    \ and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services\
    \ and their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,\
    \ at the regional, national, and European scales.\n\nThis map is the outcome of\
    \ applying a bundles cookbook developed in SERENA based on soil threats (ST) SOC\
    \ loss and erosion potential and soil ecosystem service (SES) biomass production.\
    \ The resulting bundles are clusters of SESs/STs where the intra-cluster variability\
    \ is lower than the inter-cluster variability in the mean values of the selected\
    \ SESs/STs to identify the bundles. The generated map of SESs/STs Bundles for\
    \ Estonian agricultural land is at the resolution of 100m. The input data for\
    \ the cookbook was the Map of soil organic carbon loss of mineral soils in Estonia\
    \ ; Soil water erosion potential in agricultural soils modelled by USLE, and primary\
    \ biomass production.\_"
