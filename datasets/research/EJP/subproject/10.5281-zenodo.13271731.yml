    \nThe study aimed to investigate the effect of crop diversification measures (cover\
    \ crops, ley farming, vegetation stripes) on microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE)\
    \ and its potential link to SOC accrual in agricultural soils across Europe. The\
    \ central hypothesis was that the crop diversification treatment results in more\
    \ efficient microbial use of C, thus enhancing the potential of soils to store\
    \ C. The effect of treatment was expected to vary between seasons.Topsoil was\
    \ sampled from eight experimental crop diversification sites across a pan-European\
    \ pedoclimatic gradient (Sweden, Netherlands, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Austria,\
    \ France, Slovenia, and Spain). At five sites, a second sampling was conducted\
    \ to test the effect of season on CUE (Sweden, Netherlands, France, Slovenia,\
    \ and Spain). CUE was assessed by the 18O-labelling method. To account for the\
    \ different experimental layout between sites, a meta-analysis approach was used\
    \ for statistical analysis. To test for a general pattern of the seasonal variation\
    \ in CUE across the pedoclimatic gradient, weather data (representing 3-months\
    \ weather prior sampling) was used to extract seasonal predictors.\_For further\
    \ details, please see the peer-reviewed publication.\_\n\nThe R code was developed\
    \ under R v4.4.0.\n\n\_\n\nThe repository includes the following files:\n\ndata:\n\
    \n\n\nEJP-EL_COORD_sites.csv - Provides coordinates, reference system, land use,\
    \ diversification treatment and year of establishment for the experimental sites\
    \ (n=8).\_\n\nEJP-EL_DATA_sites.csv - Provides texture, TOC and N content, and\

    \ (LaRC) Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource (POWER) Project funded through\
    \ the NASA Earth Science/Applied Science Program, i.e. NASA POWER project, for\
    \ a 3-months period prior to each sampling event: mean daily air temperature at\
    \ 2 m (T2M), the bias corrected average of total precipitation at the Earth\u2019\
    s surface (PRECTOTCORR), and the total photosynthetically active radiation incident\
    \ at the Earth\u2019s surface (ALLSKY_SFC_PAR_TOT).\_\n\nTable_S1.xlsx - Provides\

    \ them into one data.frame, specifying assignment of categories (e.g. control\
    \ vs one diversified treatment) and selections for individual analyses (e.g. seasonality\
    \ (all treatments, 5 sites), EU.gradient (control vs. one diversified treatment,\
    \ 8 sites)).\n\n02_extract_climate_data_sites.R - Extracts climate data from BIOCLIM\

    \ effects of sampling and treatment on CUE, and whether the effect of treatment\
    \ varies with sampling (i.e. interaction).\_\n\n05_define_season_by_weather_data_before_sampling.R\
