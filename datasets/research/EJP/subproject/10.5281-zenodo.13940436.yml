  abstract: "The internal EJP SOIL project SERENA contributed to the evaluation of\
    \ soil multifunctionality aiming at providing assessment tools for land planning\
    \ and soil policies at different scales. By co-working with relevant stakeholders,\
    \ the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks to assess\
    \ and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services\
    \ and their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,\
    \ at the regional, national, and European scales. \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_\
    \ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_\
    \ \_ \_ \_ \_\_\n\nIn T2.2 we discussed the definitions of soil threats (ST) and\
    \ soil-based ecosystem services (SES) to be further analysed in SERENA. In this\
    \ process we kept information from the literature review and the results of the\
    \ national prioritisation of ST and SES. This dataset description is an Excel\
    \ with sheets of literature search and national prioritisation from the participating\
    \ countries. Please read metadata at the fist sheet. Furthermore, the last sheet\
    \ shows the results of our discussion on definitions that we had to clarify before\
    \ the prioritisation.\_"
