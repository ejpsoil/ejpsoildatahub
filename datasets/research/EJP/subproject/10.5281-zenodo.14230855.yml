  abstract: "The internal EJP SOIL project SERENA contributed to the evaluation of\
    \ soil multifunctionality aiming at providing assessment tools for land planning\
    \ and soil policies at different scales. By co-working with relevant stakeholders,\
    \ the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks to assess\
    \ and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services\
    \ and their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,\
    \ at the regional, national, and European scales.\n\nThe topsoil (0-30 cm) properties\
    \ maps are prepared to evaluate soil ecosystem services in SERENA/EJP-Soil and\
    \ for applying SOC loss Cookbook and SOIL Loss Cookbook. In particular Soil Organic\
    \ Carbon content map was directly considered as an application of SOC loss Cookbook\
    \ (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.13951265\_Version 3).\n\nThey are based on Tuscany Region\
    \ soil database available at Geoscopio (https://www502.regione.toscana.it/geoscopio/pedologia.html)\
    \ and on point soil data not freely available (Lamma Consortium). More information\
    \ and requests to:\_info@lamma.toscana.it.\n\nIn accordance with the methodology\
    \ reported in the Soil Organic Carbon Mapping Cookbook (Yigini et al., 2018),\
    \ the following soil properties were mapped for all Tuscany Region:\n\n\n\nsoil\
    \ organic carbon content (dag/kg),\n\nsoil organic carbon stock (t/ha),\n\ntextural\
    \ fractions (sand, silt and clay, USDA limits, dag/kg),\n\nrock fragments (vol/vol),\n\
    \npH in water,\n\nbulk density (g/cm3).\n\n\nThey were obtained through Digital\
    \ Soil Mapping (DSM) approach, based on correlations with numerous environmental\
    \ factors and using Random Forest algorithm.\n\nAll the maps have a 100 m spatial\
    \ resolution."
