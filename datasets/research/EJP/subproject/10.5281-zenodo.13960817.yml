  abstract: "The internal EJP SOIL project\_SERENA contributed to the evaluation of\
    \ soil multifunctionality aiming at providing assessment tools for land planning\
    \ and soil policies at different scales. By co-working with relevant stakeholders,\
    \ the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks to assess\
    \ and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services\
    \ and their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,\
    \ at the regional, national, and European scales.\n\nThe dataset corresponds to\
    \ a map of greenhouse gas emissions, measured in net ecosystem productivity. The\
    \ map is the result of applying the GHG cookbook developed in SERENA/EJP-Soil.\
    \ It is based on GPP products derived from the MODIS algorithm in 2014, combined\
    \ with soil moisture and temperature data. The final map includes 45 bands with\
    \ the NEP values (in g C/m2) of each 8-day period between 2-1-2014 and 31-12-2014.\
    \ The map has a 500 m spatial resolution."
