  abstract: "Soil data collected in an agricultural area with vegetable crops in Spain\
    \ (Campo de Cartagena). The data refers to soil properties of 141 soil samples\
    \ collected at a depth of 0-10 cm, considering a regular sampling grid, in different\
    \ commercial fields with varying soil salinity. The samples were collected at\
    \ a period when the soil was bare, during two consecutive summers, following the\
    \ harvest of the annual crops, and pictures of the soil surface were taken for\
    \ eventual correction of corresponding remote sensing imaging. The data includes:\
    \ soil organic carbon (SOC) (Walkley-Black method), soil water content, electric\
    \ conductivity of the saturated soil paste (ECe), EC1:5, soil texture, stone content\
    \ and pH1:2.5. \n\n\_\n\nThe data may be representative of the soil conditions\
    \ of the area, which is an intensive productive agricultural low land, potentially\
    \ prone to the development of soil salinity as a result of the rise of saline\
    \ groundwater and/or irrigation. The data can be used to establish relations between\
    \ soil salinity (ECe) and other soil properties as well as build prediction models\
    \ of the soil properties from remote sensing namely, for developing models for\
    \ SOC prediction under the STEROPES project (WP3, WP5 and WP6).The aim of the\
    \ collected dataset was to be able to analyze the influence of soil salinity in\
    \ SOC prediction from remote sensing.\n\n\_\n\nData in the form of MS Excel file\
    \ (xlsx).\n\n\_\n\n\_"
