  abstract: 'Long-term field experiments (LTEs) are crucial sources of knowledge on
    agricultural soil management. They are vitally important in monitoring, understanding
    and proving the changes in soil properties and crop production occurring as a
    result of agricultural management practices and climate change. Long-term field
    experiments will also be essential in the future and cannot be replaced by new
    analytical techniques or models; on the contrary, they are an indispensable basis
    for the calibration and validation of these techniques. Because of longevity,
    it is fairly costly to maintain them. Therefore, efforts aiming at more extensive
    and cooperative use of LTEs and the corresponding data should be promoted. This
    database collected with EJP SOIL (task 7.3) contains metadata from more than 200
    LTEs across Europe. Metadata collected include precise description of the treatments
    (combination of factors) investigated related to tillage, crops, amendments, grazing
    and pest/weed management as well as measurements collected and pedo-climatic information.
