  abstract: "This dataset includes ammonia volatilization measurements led by ECOSYS\
    \ INRAE with Caract\u2019Air device. Ammonia measurements, based on the principle\
    \ of a mass balance in dynamic chambers are performed under thoroughly controlled\
    \ and replicative conditions. Caract\u2019Air was designed to be as close as possible\
    \ to field conditions (in situ soil cores) while optimizing ambient conditions\
    \ (temperature, air humidity and soil water content) and exchange conditions (flow\
    \ rate, head volume, air circulation conditions) (G\xE9nermont et al., 2021; D\xE9\
    cuq et al., 2023). A variety of EOMs are represented ranging from historic livestock\
    \ effluents and manure to emerging biowastes produced by human urban and agro-industrial\
    \ activities, all these biowastes having undergone a variety of treatments: raw,\
    \ separated, composted, anaerobically stored slurries, farm yard manure, sewage\
    \ sludges, municipal and domestic wastes; various digestats from mechanization;\
    \ urine based fertilizers; etc. The types and origins of the EOM are reported.\
    \ The physico-chemical properties of the EOM as well as soils on which the EOM\
    \ were applied are detailed, leading to 20 and 30 parameters accompanied by information\
    \ on analytical methods. Measurement conditions are also described including the\
    \ application dose, the experimental set duration, the ambient conditions, and\
    \ also the reproductibily conditions, etc. Finally, ammonia volatilization data\
    \ are compiled, in terms of total cumulative loss (kg N/ha) or volatilization\
    \ rates (% N and % N-NH4 applied)."
