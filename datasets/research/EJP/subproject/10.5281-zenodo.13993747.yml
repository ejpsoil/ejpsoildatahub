  abstract: "The internal EJP SOIL project SERENA contributed to the evaluation of\
    \ soil multifunctionality aiming at providing assessment tools for land planning\
    \ and soil policies at different scales. By co-working with relevant stakeholders,\
    \ the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks to assess\
    \ and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services\
    \ and their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,\
    \ at the regional, national, and European scales.\n\n\n\nThe present data was\
    \ prepared according to the methodology of SERENA soil erosion control cookbook\
    \ for the territory of Slovakia. The map of soil loss by water erosion (soil threat)\
    \ was based on the RUSLE model. or the soil erosion control, the difference between\
    \ the erosion map without vegetation (C-factor = 1) and the erosion map with vegetation\
    \ was calculated.\_\n\n\n\n\n\nThe objective of SERENA project was to develop\
    \ methods to calculate and map soil-based ecosystem services and soil threats.\_\
    \n\n\n\n\nTo create the soil loss map we used theese data:\_\n\n\n\n\n\_R factor\
    \ - we used data from 100 automatic rain stations on minute rainfall for about\
    \ 10-year period (national dataset)\_\n\n\n\n\nK factor \u2013 we used the\_ source\
    \ proposed in the cookbook from ESDAC\_ dataset: Soil Erodibility (K- Factor)\
    \ High Resolution dataset for Europe\_\n\n\n\n\nLS factor \u2013 we used the\_\
    \ source proposed in the cookbook from ESDAC dataset: LS-factor (Slope Length\
    \ and Steepness factor) for Slovakia\_\n\n\n\n\nC factor \u2013 we used LPIS database-this\
    \ has information about crops on agricultural soil. We have values of C factor\
    \ for all crops.\_\n\n\n\n\nP factor \u2013 we used the source proposed in the\
    \ cookbook from ESDAC dataset:\u202FP factor for Slovakia. This map has values\
    \ about 0.99 for Slovakia, so P-factor does not have much effect on the resulting\
    \ erosion.\_\_\n\n\n\n\nThe delivered map was prepared in GeoTIFF format in the\
    \ resolution of 500 * 500 m.\_"
