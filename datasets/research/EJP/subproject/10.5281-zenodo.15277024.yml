  abstract: "This study aims to investigate alternative management practices for rice\
    \ straw in tropical lowland rice-soybean systems. The goal is to twofold:\_ first,\
    \ to identify methods that maximize the yield of the subsequent soybean crop,\
    \ and second, to quantify the effects of these practices on soil properties. \"\
    Ten treatments (below) consisting of a combination of rice straw management (burning,\
    \ removal and incorporation with disc harrow, leveling disc harrow, and knife-roller)\
    \ with soybean sowing (no-tillage and conventional) were evaluated in a completely\
    \ randomized design, with six replications. The disc harrow operated at 0.20-0.25\
    \ m, the leveling disc harrow at 0.10 m, and the knife-roller at 0.13 m depth.\
    \ The total plot area was 600 m2 (10 m wide and 60 m long).\n\n\_\n\nTillage treatments\
    \ were:\n\nBurning (M1)\n\nStraw removal (M2)\n\nIncorporation with one pass of\
    \ a disc harrow (GA) and two (M3) or three (M4) passes of a leveling harrow (GN)\n\
    \nIncorporation with one pass of a roller knife (RF) and no-till soybean planting\
    \ (M5)\n\nIncorporation with one pass of RF and two (M6) or three (M7) passes\
    \ of GN\n\nIncorporation with two passes of RF and no-till soybean planting (M8)\n\
    \nTwo (M9) or three (M10) passes of GN.\" \"Grain yield was determined in an area\
    \ of 2.55 m\xB2, corresponding to six 2.5 m rows spaced 0.17 m apart, which was\
    \ expressed in kg ha-1, after moisture was adjusted to 13%.\n\n\_\n\nThe yield\
    \ components were determined: the number of panicles in one meter of the planting\
    \ row; plant height, measured from the soil level to the tip of the panicle in\
    \ five tillers. The HI was obtained by the ratio between grain yield and total\
    \ dry matter in 1 m2. The number of grains and empty spikelets in ten panicles\
    \ and the mass of 100 grains. The determination of the industrial quality of grains\
    \ in 100 g samples of processed seeds. Rice and soybean grain yields were determined\
    \ annually and the cumulative yields of these crops were calculated.\" The experimental\
    \ design is completely randomized, with six replicates. \"2015 and 2017: 0-10,\
    \ 10-20cm\n\n2023: 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40cm\" \"This study investigated the\
    \ following chemical properties of the soil: pH, and the levels of calcium (Ca2+),\
    \ magnesium (Mg2+), hydrogen (H+), aluminum (Al3+), phosphorus (P), potassium\
    \ (K+), copper (Cu2+), zinc (Zn2+), iron (Fe3+), manganese (Mn2+), and organic\
    \ matter.\n\n\_\n\n-Soil pH was measured in water.\n\n-Calcium and magnesium were\
    \ extracted using a 1 molar potassium chloride (KCl) solution and then analyzed\
    \ by atomic absorption spectroscopy.\n\n-Potential acidity (the combined amount\
    \ of hydrogen and aluminum) was determined through titration with a 0.5 molar\
    \ calcium acetate solution at a pH of 7.\n\n-Phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients\
    \ were extracted with Mehlich 1 solution (a mixture of 0.5 N hydrochloric acid\
    \ (HCl) and 0.025 N sulfuric acid (H2SO4)) and analyzed by inductively coupled\
    \ plasma atomic emission spectroscopy.\n\n-Soil organic matter (SOM) was estimated\
    \ by multiplying the total organic carbon content of the soil by 1.724. This calculation\
    \ was based on the chromic acid titration method.\n\n\_\n\nThe specific methods\
    \ used for these analyses were referenced from Teixeira et al. (2017) and Soltanpour\
    \ et al. (1996).\" \"2015 and 2017: 0-10, 10-20cm\n\n2023: 0-10, 10-20, 20-30,\
    \ 30-40cm\n\n\_\n\n- In 2015 and 2017, soil organic carbon content was estimated\
    \ indirectly by measuring soil organic matter (SOM) using the chromic acid titration\
    \ method (Teixeira et al., 2017). The total soil organic carbon content was obtained\
    \ by multiplying the SOM by a factor of 1.724.\n\n- In 2023, soil organic carbon\
    \ content was measured directly using dry combustion with Total Organic Carbon\
    \ (TOC) analysis.\n\n- Soil carbon stocks were calculated using soil bulk density.\
    \ A volumetric ring was used to determine the bulk density at different depths\
    \ (0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-30 cm, and 30-40 cm). Since bulk density varied between\
    \ treatments, estimates of soil organic carbon stocks (in Mg ha-1) were based\
    \ on equivalent soil masses (Sisti et al., 2004).\" The following soil physical\
    \ properties were measured: bulk density, total porosity, microporosity, and macroporosity.\
    \ Additionally, plant available water capacity was determined following the method\
    \ of Teixeira et al. (2017). The S index, an indicator of soil physical quality,\
    \ was calculated based on Dexter (2004). Finally, air capacity (AC) was assessed\
    \ using the method outlined by Reynolds et al. (2002). Clay loam texture \"-Sample\
    \ collection: Soil samples for biological properties were collected at a depth\
    \ of 0-10 cm.\n\n\_\n\n-Enzyme analysis: Betaglucosidase, aryl-sulfatase, and\
    \ acid phosphatase activities were determined following the methods described\
    \ by Tabatabai (1994) as modified by Lopes (2013). The analysis was performed\
    \ using dried air-sampled soil.\""
