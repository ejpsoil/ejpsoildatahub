  abstract: "The internal EJP SOIL project SERENA contributed to the evaluation of\
    \ soil multifunctionality aiming at providing assessment tools for land planning\
    \ and soil policies at different scales. By co-working with relevant stakeholders,\
    \ the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks to assess\
    \ and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services\
    \ and their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,\
    \ at the regional, national, and European scales.\n\nData for NEP analysis was\
    \ provided through the Microsoft Teams shared folder. However, MODIS data was\
    \ obtained using the MODISTools R package in RStudio (R 4.3.1). Nine MODIS tiles\
    \ to cover the extent of Ireland were merged and exported to QGIS for analysis.\_\
    \n\nAn 8-day NEP analysis was conducted for the entirety of the Republic of Ireland\
    \ under wheat crop from 02-09 of January. However, wheat production in Ireland\
    \ is largely centred around several key regions in the east/central-east due to\
    \ the relative dominance of grassland and alternative agricultural regimes elsewhere.\
    \ This resulted in quite a sparse visualisation at national scale. Hence, a refined\
    \ analysis for the same period in County Meath"
