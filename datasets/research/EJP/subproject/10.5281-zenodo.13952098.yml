  abstract: "The internal EJP SOIL project SERENA contributed to the evaluation of\
    \ soil multifunctionality aiming at providing assessment tools for land planning\
    \ and soil policies at different scales. By co-working with relevant stakeholders,\
    \ the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks to assess\
    \ and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services\
    \ and their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,\
    \ at the regional, national, and European scales.\n\nOne of the\_objective of\
    \ SERENA project was to develop methods to calculate and map soil-based ecosystem\
    \ services and soil threats. The present data was prepared according to the methodology\
    \ of the SERENA Soil erosion and soil erosion control cookbook.\_ Soil loss was\
    \ used as an indicator for soil erosion (ST). The map of soil mass not eroded\
    \ was based on the RUSLE model. Soil erosion control was calculated as the difference\
    \ between potential and actual soil erosion (SES, ecosystem service of soil erosion\
    \ protection, i.e. soil eroded mass retained by vegetation, Mg/ha/y). For Italy,\
    \ the cookbook was applied in the Tuscany region. \_\n\n\n\n\nTo create the soil\
    \ loss map we used:\_\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor R-factor, not freely available database\
    \ of meteorological parameters spatialized at 250 m (minimum and maximum daily\
    \ air temperature; cumulate daily precipitation) over Tuscany region (period 1990\u2013\
    2022, Lamma Consortium)\_ and a local linear equation between R and mean annual\
    \ precipitation (P); \n\nfor C -factor, Regional Land use map 1:10.000 (2018,\
    \ freely available at:\_https://www502.regione.toscana.it/geoscopio/usocoperturasuolo.html)\
    \ and ESDAC method (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.05.021) ; \_\n\n\
    for K-factor, sand, silt, clay, and O.C. (%) maps (built from 4.000 soil profiles,\
    \ following FAO\u2019s methodology in GSP-GSOC map, Lamma Consortium), and Torri\
    \ et al. (1997) function; \n\nfor LS-factor, DEM 10 m of Tuscany, (freely available\
    \ at\_https://www502.regione.toscana.it/geoscopio/cartoteca.html99) and Desmet\
    \ & Govers (1996) SAGA tool (applied at 10 m and upscaled); \n\nfor P-factor,\
    \ not freely available database 1:10.00 of terraced areas (Lamma Consortium, 2020)\
    \ (for terraced areas a multiplication factor of\_ 0.5\_ was considered, based\
    \ on expert evaluation) \n\nfor P-factor, not freely available database 1:10.00\
    \ of terraced areas (Lamma Consortium, 2020) (for terraced areas a multiplication\
    \ factor\_of\_ 0.5\_ was considered, based on expert evaluation)\_\n\n\n\n\n\n\
    Maps was delivered in the GeoTIFF format in the resolution of 100m. \_\n\n\n\n\
    \nDelivered data will be validated by stakeholders from Italy (scientist) in October,\
    \ 2024.\_"
