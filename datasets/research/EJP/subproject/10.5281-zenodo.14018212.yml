  abstract: "General description of SERENA\n\nThe internal EJP SOIL project SERENA\
    \ contributed to the evaluation of soil multifunctionality aiming at providing\
    \ assessment tools for land planning and soil policies at different scales. By\
    \ co-working with relevant stakeholders, the project provided co-developed indicators\
    \ and associated cookbooks to assess and map them, to report both on soil degradation,\
    \ soil-based ecosystem services and their bundles, under actual conditions and\
    \ for climate and land-use changes, at the regional, national, and European scales.\n\
    \nFiles description\n\nData was prepared as a result of SERENA EJP SOIL. The attached\
    \ files are a part of the analysis of Assessment of Soil Threats and Ecosystem\
    \ Services from each MS with the harmonized procedures. SERENA deliverable 3.3\
    \ (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13991087). Data was prepared based on the DSM\
    \ approach using QRF algorithm. We used over 40000 points to create maps of SOC\
    \ content for 2018 and climate change RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios (https://opendap.4tu.nl/thredds/catalog/data2/uuid/e940ec1a-71a0-449e-bbe3-29217f2ba31d/catalog.html)\
    \ to\_ predict SOC content for 2050."
