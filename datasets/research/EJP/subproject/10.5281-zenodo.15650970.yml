  abstract: "The study was performed in the Experimental Demonstration Base of Conservation\
    \ Tillage of Shanxi Agricultural University, Taigu District, Jinzhong City, Shanxi\
    \ Province, China. Fresh soil, undisturbed soil, and cutting ring soil samples\
    \ were collected from the 0-10, 10-20, 20-40, and 40-60 cm soil layers in various\
    \ plots of the experimental field before the start of the experiment in 2016 (Before\
    \ the experiment, Be) and during the winter wheat harvest in 2020-2023. To maintain\
    \ the soil physical properties, such as porosity and water content in its natural\
    \ state, the samples of undisturbed soil and cutting ring soil were obtained by\
    \ the press-in method. Among them, fresh soil was used for SSA determination,\
    \ undisturbed soil was partly used to measure soil aggregates and other related\
    \ properties, and partly for SOC, STN, and SPA determinations, and cutting ring\
    \ soil was used to measure soil three-phase properties.\n\n\_"
