  abstract: "The current dataset includes 320 topsoil samples (0\u201320\u202Fcm depth)\
    \ collected from four agricultural sites in the Czech Republic. The samples were\
    \ gathered from P\u0159estavlky, Klu\u010Dov, Nov\xE1 Ves nad Popelkou, and Udrnice\
    \ (80 samples from each site) in June 2021. It contains sample coordinates and\
    \ some soil parameters including SOC and texture, prepared and stored in MS Excel\
    \ (.xlsx) format. The data were used in STEROPES WP1 (basic local model development),\
    \ WP3 (effect of texture), and WP4 (effect of vegetation and plant residues).\_"
