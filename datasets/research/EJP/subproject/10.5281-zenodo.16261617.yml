  abstract: "Dataset description\n\nThis is the corresponding dataset to the publication\
    \ \"Austrian NIR Soil Spectral Library for Soil Health Assessments\" by Fohrafellner\
    \ et al. (2025). In this publication, we created the first Austrian Near-Infrared\
    \ (NIR) Soil Spectral Library (680 \u2013 2500 nm) using 2,129 legacy samples\
    \ from all environmental zones of Austria. Additionally, we utilized partial least\
    \ squares regression modeling to evaluate the dataset's current effectiveness\
    \ for soil health assessments. The dataset contains three tabs, \"Document meta\
    \ data\", \"Legend\" and \"Dataset\". Tab \"Document meta data\" gives information\
    \ on the authors, the data collection time frame, terms of use, etc. In \"Legend\"\
    , each column of the \"Dataset\" is described. The \"Dataset\" contains information\
    \ on the legacy soil samples including:\_\n\n\n\nmeta data (e.g. sample number,\
    \ sampling year, zip code, environmental zone, land use), \n\nsoil properties\
    \ (soil organic carbon [SOC], SOC to clay ratio, total carbon, labile carbon,\
    \ CaCO3, total nitrogen, plant available phosphorus, pH measured in CaCl2 and\
    \ acetate, cation exchange capacity, texture [sand, silt, clay content], and clay\
    \ content measured by density in suspension), and\n\nmeasured NIR soil spectra,\
    \ also for the standards.\n\n\nProject description\n\nThis Austrian NIR Soil Spectral\
    \ Library was built within the ProbeField project (November 2021 \u2013 January\
    \ 2025), which was part of the European Joint Program for SOIL \"Towards climate-smart\
    \ sustainable management of agricultural soils\" (EJP SOIL) funded by the European\
    \ Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant Agreement N\xB0\
    \ 862695). The project aimed to create a protocol detailing procedures and methodologies\
    \ for accurately estimating fertility-related properties in agricultural soils\
    \ in the field. Additionally, the potential for extending this data to two- and\
    \ three-dimensional mapping using co-variates was demonstrated. ProbeField further\
    \ collected field spectra that closely match laboratory spectra, enabling the\
    \ prediction of soil properties using models calibrated with soil spectral libraries.\n\
