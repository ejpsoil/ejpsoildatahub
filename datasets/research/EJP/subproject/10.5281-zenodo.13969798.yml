  abstract: "The internal EJP SOIL project SERENA contributed to the evaluation of\
    \ soil multifunctionality aiming at providing assessment tools for land planning\
    \ and soil policies at different scales. By co-working with relevant stakeholders,\
    \ the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks to assess\
    \ and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services\
    \ and their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,\
    \ at the regional, national, and European scales.\n\nThe map is the result of\
    \ applying the SOC loss cookbook developed in SERENA/EJP-Soil. It is based on\
    \ Tuscany Region SOCdatabase (Gardin et al., 2021). Not freely available (Lamma\
    \ Consortium). More information and requests to: info@lamma.toscana.it.\n\nThree\
    \ versions of the map were produced.\n\nIn versions v1 and v2, the dataset corresponds\
    \ to a map of SOC concentrations for the Tuscany Region produced using a geostatistical\
    \ approach. Ordinary kriging (Chil\xE8s & Delfiner, 2012) coupled with local geostatistics\
    \ (LGS) was used to map SOC concentration (%) in the topsoil (0-30 cm) at a regional\
    \ scale in the Tuscany Region (Italy). The map has a 50 m spatial resolution.\n\
    \nIn version v3, a different approach to applying SOC loss cookbook was used.\
    \ Particularly, Random Forest regression algorithm with numerous spatial covariates\
    \ was applied for mapping SOC content (%) in the topsoil (0-30 cm) at regional\
    \ scale in Tuscany Region (Italy). \_The map has a 100 m spatial resolution."
