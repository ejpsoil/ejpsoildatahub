  abstract: "Extending and optimizing recycling of organic wastes in agriculture is\
    \ a key element in shifting conventional agriculture towards systems adapted to\
    \ both energy depletion and climate change. Long-term field experiments (LTEs)\
    \ play a crucial role in assessing and modelling the effects of repeated exogenous\
    \ organic matter (EOM) application to soil, which allows to formulate locally\
    \ adapted recommendations of use. \_Nevertheless, a specific database focussing\
    \ on LTEs dealing with organic fertilization in Europe were missing. To close\
    \ this gap, we listed LTEs dealing with repeated application of EOM from existing\
    \ online databases, and collected and harmonized all available metadata. The aim\
    \ of this work was threefold: (1) to facilitate connections between comparable\
    \ LTEs to foster data harmonization and compilation, (2) to map the diversity\
    \ of pedoclimatic contexts and experimental designs in the LTE list and, (3) to\
    \ highlight current knowledge gaps and research needs.\_Data were collected from\
    \ five online databases, allowing us to describe 201 LTEs. Key characteristics\
    \ such as trial name, responsible institution, location, pedoclimatic context,\
    \ duration, crop type and availability of online resources are well-described\
    \ in contrast to LTE goal and owner contact, experimental design, soil type, studied\
    \ EOM and monitored parameters (EOM characteristics, soil and crop properties),\
    \ which are more difficult to gather and harmonize. The analysis of LTE metadata\
    \ highlighted first that substantial harmonization efforts are required, particularly\
    \ regarding the reporting of soil, crop and EOM properties over time. Second,\
    \ the survey outlines that some European regions are poorly represented in the\
    \ database, which may result either from an absence of LTE or from a lack of reporting.\
    \ To close this gap, we call LTE managers to complete the current database with\
    \ any missing relevant LTE or additional metadata, using the editable online repository\
    \ attached to this document. In the future, improvement of predictive models could\
    \ contribute to provide recommendations of EOM use to uncovered situations, whether\
    \ in terms of soil, climate or type of EOM. Third, long-term effects on soil properties\
    \ such as changes in soil biology composition or accumulation of organic contaminants\
    \ (PFAS, microplastics, antibiotics, ...) appear to be poorly documented. LTEs\
    \ have a key role to play in answering these emerging questions, having the potential\
    \ to provide the rationale to fix acceptable thresholds in soils and EOMs for\
    \ emerging pollutants and accordingly provide the best possible guidelines for\
    \ the use of EOM in agriculture.\_\n\nSee related report at\_https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14161379."
