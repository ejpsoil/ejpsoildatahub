  abstract: "General description of SERENA\n\nThe internal EJP SOIL project SERENA\
    \ contributed to the evaluation of soil multifunctionality aiming at providing\
    \ assessment tools for land planning and soil policies at different scales. By\
    \ co-working with relevant stakeholders, the project provided co-developed indicators\
    \ and associated cookbooks to assess and map them, to report both on soil degradation,\
    \ soil-based ecosystem services and their bundles, under actual conditions and\
    \ for climate and land-use changes, at the regional, national, and European scales.\n\
    \nFiles description\n\nData was prepared as a result of SERENA EJP SOIL. The attached\
    \ files are a part of the analysis of Assessment of Soil Threats and Ecosystem\
    \ Services from each MS with the harmonized procedures. SERENA deliverable 3.3\
    \ (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13991087).\_\n\nThe present dataset corresponds\
    \ to a map of Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP) for Poland (agricultural areass)\
    \ as wheat by the Eurocrop 2028 spatial product (d\u2019Andrimont et al. 2021).\
    \ The map is the result of applying the NEP cookbook developed in SERENA/EJP-Soil\
    \ to the area of interest (AOI) input data. NEP is expressed for a single 8-day\
    \ period in early summer as it is the date with the highest value. The NEP value\
    \ is a 2014 average for the particular 8-day period. NEP was used as an indicator\
    \ of greenhouse gasses and climate regulation supported by soils.\_"
