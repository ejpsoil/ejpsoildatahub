  abstract: "The internal EJP SOIL project SERENA contributed to the evaluation of\
    \ soil multifunctionality aiming at providing assessment tools for land planning\
    \ and soil policies at different scales. By co-working with relevant stakeholders,\
    \ the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks to assess\
    \ and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services\
    \ and their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,\
    \ at the regional, national and European scales.The data was prepared according\
    \ to the Level 2 methodology of the SERENA soil sealing cookbook. For Belgium,\
    \ the application was carried out at the regional scale for the Flanders region.\
    \ \_The automatically generated yearly soil sealing maps (1 m resolution GeoTIFF\
    \ rasters)\_combine \u201Cknown\u201D sealing from administrative databases (buildings\
    \ and transport infrastructure) with modelled sealing based on artificial intelligence.\
    \ Administrative databases do not (adequately) cover parking lots, private driveways\
    \ and garden terraces, which are a substantial part of the sealed area in Flanders.\
    \ Hence, a machine learning model was built for deriving this remaining sealing\
    \ from aerial imagery. For this purpose, an assessor manually labeled the sealed\
    \ parts on a subset of the images. Based on this training set, a convolutional\
    \ neural network model was used to produce a sealing probability map, which was\
    \ converted to a binary modelled sealing map. Finally, a continuity correction\
    \ was applied to ensure a temporally consistent result across the yearly maps.\
    \ \_The objective of the SERENA project was to develop methods to calculate and\
    \ map soil-based ecosystem services and soil threats. The selected indicator was\
    \ the degree of soil sealing. By evaluating this degree at two moments in time,\
    \ the change in soil sealing can be determined. \_\_The following data were used:\_\
    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge-scale Reference Database (Grootschalig Referentiebestand\
    \ or Basiskaart), the digital topographic reference map for Flanders (vector)\_\
    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium-scale annual winter aerial images of Flanders (15\
    \ or 25 cm raster resolution)\n\n\n\nThis dataset is originally hosted at Geopunt\
    \ (www.geopunt.be). For the most up-to-date version of the dataset, please access\
    \ the data from the Geopunt repository."
