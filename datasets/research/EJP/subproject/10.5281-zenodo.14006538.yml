  abstract: 'The internal EJP SOIL project SERENA contributed to evaluating soil multifunctionality,
    aiming to provide assessment tools for land planning and soil policies at different
    scales. By co-working with relevant stakeholders, the project provided co-developed
    indicators and associated cookbooks to assess and map them, to report both on
    soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services and their bundles, under actual
    conditions and for climate and land-use changes, at the regional, national, and
    European scales.


    The dataset corresponds to a map of Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) concentration (g
    kg-1) in Portugal. The map of soil organic carbon, as an indicator of SOC loss
    threat, was based on ordinary kriging and has a spatial resolution of 50 m. Soil
    organic carbon (0-0.20 m) data from LUCAS 2018 TOPSOIL data - ESDAC - European
    Commission database, which is freely available (https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/content/lucas-2018-topsoil-data).'
