  abstract: "The dataset contains (i) input data from 12 study sites in Europe for\
    \ modelling the \u201Cwheel load carrying capacity (WLCC)\u201D with an updated\
    \ version of the SaSCiA-model (Kuhwald et al. 2018, 2022) and (ii) the results\
    \ of the modelling. The input data consists of soil profile data, crop rotations\
    \ and climate projection data (point data, derived from free available CMIP6 model\
    \ results) for each site.\n\nThe modelling results are predictions of the WLCC\
    \ for each study site for 10 climate models, each with 2 scenarios (SSP 126 and\
    \ SSP 585) for the period 2020-2100 on a daily basis. \_\n\nThe model results\
    \ were used to analyse the impact of climate change on WLCC for different pedoclimatic\
    \ zones.\n\nThe dataset is related to the publication \"Kuhwald and Lamande (202x;\
    \ in preperation): Modelling soil compaction risk under climate change: an analysis\
    \ of wheel load carrying capacity (WLCC) for different pedoclimatic zones in Europe\"\
