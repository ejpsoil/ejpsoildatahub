  abstract: "The database consists of 50 field experiments located in 45 sites with\
    \ mostly loamy soil texture across 15 European countries, covering European climate\
    \ zones, from Boreal to Mediterranean South. Mean annual precipitation and mean\
    \ annual temperature measured at the experimental sites included in this meta-analysis\
    \ ranged from 360 mm to 1,050 mm and from 3.4 \xB0C to 16.3 \xB0C, respectively.A\
    \ total of 7 studies each from Sweden and Poland were included, 6 from Italy and\
    \ Spain, 4 from Denmark and Estonia, 3 from Germany, 2 from Finland, Latvia, Norway,\
    \ Switzerland and the UK, and 1 from Austria, the Netherlands and France. In organic\
    \ systems, animal-based fertilizers (manure, slurry, manure compost) was applied\
    \ in 11 studies, plant-based fertilizers (legumes and mixed green manure) in 24\
    \ studies, and both types of organic fertilizers in 13 studies. N input in organic\
    \ systems was less than in conventional systems in 24 studies, equal in 3 studies,\
    \ higher in 4 studies, and not reported in 19 studies. In most studies, fields\
    \ were conventionally tilled and not irrigated. The duration of cereal-based organic\
    \ systems ranges from 3 to 35 years. Yields of winter wheat, winter rye, spring\
    \ barley, spring wheat, or oats were measured from 3 to 30 years, and the duration\
    \ of organic rotations varied from two to eight years.\_"
