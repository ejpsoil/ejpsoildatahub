  abstract: The internal EJP SOIL project SERENA contributed to the evaluation of
    soil multifunctionality aiming at providing assessment tools for land planning
    and soil policies at different scales. By co-working with relevant stakeholders,
    the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks to assess
    and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services
    and their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,
    at the regional, national, and European scales.
