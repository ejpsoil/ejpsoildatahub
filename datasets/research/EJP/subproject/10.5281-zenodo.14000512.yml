  abstract: "The internal EJP SOIL project SERENA contributed to the evaluation of\
    \ soil multifunctionality aiming at providing assessment tools for land planning\
    \ and soil policies at different scales. By co-working with relevant stakeholders,\
    \ the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks to assess\
    \ and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services\
    \ and their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,\
    \ at the regional, national, and European scales. \_ \_ \_ \_\n\nThe study evaluated\
    \ Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP), a key indicator of carbon dynamics and ecosystem\
    \ health that captures the balance between gross primary productivity and total\
    \ ecosystem respiration under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate change scenarios.\
    \ The scenarios incorporate NEP calculations from the SERENA project\u2019s GHG\
    \ Cookbook, which integrates MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)\
    \ terrestrial primary productivity data with spatially explicit climate variables,\
    \ such as average temperatures (derived from minimum and maximum daily temperatures)\
    \ and soil volumetric moisture content. The baseline NEP layer for this analysis\
    \ was derived from the GHG Cookbook\u2019s 8-day NEP calculation for April 24\
    \ to May 1, 2014. This study specifically mapped NEP values in wheat fields within\
    \ Peipsi\xE4\xE4re municipality, Estonia, under the RCP4.5 scenario for the future\
    \ periods 2041\u20132070 and 2071\u20132100. The findings provide initial insights\
    \ into NEP scenario modeling related to climate change, indicating that more advanced\
    \ analyses would be advantageous for refining the methodology. Furthermore, incorporating\
    \ Estonia\u2019s specific pedoclimatic conditions and considering the dynamics\
    \ of terrestrial primary productivity within the datasets would greatly improve\
    \ the accuracy of projections.\n\nThis dataset includes an 8-day NEP layer for\
    \ wheat fields in Peipsi\xE4\xE4re municipality, Estonia, under the RCP4.5 climate\
    \ pathway for the periods 2041\u20132070 and 2071\u20132100. The files, named\
    \ SERENA_EJPSOIL_EE_CC_scenario_NEP_RCP4.5_2041-2070.gpkg and SERENA_EJPSOIL_EE_CC_scenario_NEP_RCP4.5_2071-2100.gpkg,\
    \ are formatted as GeoPackages (GPKG).\_"
