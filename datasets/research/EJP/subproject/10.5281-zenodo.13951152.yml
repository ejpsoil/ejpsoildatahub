  abstract: "The internal EJP SOIL project\_SERENA contributed to the evaluation of\
    \ soil multifunctionality aiming at providing assessment tools for land planning\
    \ and soil policies at different scales. By co-working with relevant\_stakeholders,\
    \ the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks to assess\
    \ and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services\
    \ and their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,\
    \ at\_the regional, national, and European scales.\n\nOne of the objective of\
    \ SERENA project was to develop methods to calculate and map soil-based ecosystem\
    \ services and soil threats. The present data was prepared according to the methodology\
    \ of the SERENA Soil erosion and soil erosion control cookbook.\_ Soil loss was\
    \ used as an indicator for soil erosion (ST). The map of soil loss by water erosion\
    \ (soil threat) was based on the RUSLE model. For Italy, the cookbook was applied\
    \ in the Tuscany region.\_\_To create the soil loss map we used:\n\n\n\nfor R-factor,\
    \ not freely available database of meteorological parameters spatialized at 250\
    \ m (minimum and maximum daily air temperature; cumulate daily precipitation)\
    \ over Tuscany region (period 1990\u20132022, Lamma Consortium) \_and a local\
    \ linear equation between R and mean annual precipitation (P);\n\nfor C -factor,\
    \ Regional Land use map 1:10.000 (2018, freely available at: https://www502.regione.toscana.it/geoscopio/usocoperturasuolo.html)\
    \ and ESDAC method (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.05.021) ;\_\n\n\
    for K-factor, sand, silt, clay, and O.C. (%) maps (built from 4.000 soil profiles,\
    \ following FAO\u2019s methodology in GSP-GSOC map, Lamma Consortium), and Torri\
    \ et al. (1997) function;\n\nfor LS-factor, DEM 10 m of Tuscany, (freely available\
    \ at https://www502.regione.toscana.it/geoscopio/cartoteca.html99) and Desmet\
    \ & Govers (1996) SAGA tool (applied at 10 m and upscaled);\n\nfor P-factor, not\
    \ freely available database 1:10.00 of terraced areas (Lamma Consortium, 2020)\
    \ (for terraced areas a multiplication factor of \_0.5 \_was considered, based\
    \ on expert evaluation)\n\n\nMaps was delivered in the GeoTIFF format in the resolution\
    \ of 100m.\_Delivered data will be validated by stakeholders from Italy (scientist)\
    \ in October, 2024."
