  abstract: "This dataset includes the data that was used in the Global Change Biology\
    \ publication \"Towards an ecosystem capacity to stabilise organic carbon in soils\"\
    \ by Poeplau et al.. It contains two xlsx files, with dataset_full.xlsx including\
    \ all sites with soil properties that were used in the first part of the manuscript.\
    \ It is a combined dataset from several open source datasets with a total of 1396\
    \ individual sites. The file modelled_converged.xlsx includes the RothC model\
    \ results of a total of 587 sites, for which modelling was possible and a convergence\
    \ of measured and modelled data was reached. Both files include two sheets, one\
    \ with a short explanation of the variable names and one data sheet.\_"
