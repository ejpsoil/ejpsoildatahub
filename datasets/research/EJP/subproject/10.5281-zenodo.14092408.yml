  abstract: "The EJP Soil-project PRAC2LIV conducted a stocktake of Decision Support\
    \ Tools (DSTs) focused on three key themes: soil organic matter, nutrient use\
    \ efficiency, and water retention, currently in use in EJP SOIL countries. Building\
    \ on previous stocktakes and an extensive literature review, this assessment included\
    \ DSTs ranging from simple tools to next-generation support systems. Both the\
    \ scientific basis of these DSTs, as well as their implementation and adoption\
    \ at the farm level, were evaluated. In addition, mock-up designs for DSTs (mobile\
    \ apps) related to the three themes were created. The results of the stocktake\
    \ were discussed with various stakeholders through regional workshops, within\
    \ the broader context of soil health. Further elaboration was conducted using\
    \ a novel visualization method, in a participatory approach, with a focus on \u201C\
    DSTs for Soil Health in Living Labs.\u201D By combining the findings from the\
    \ literature, stocktake, workshops, mock-up designs, and visualization, conclusions\
    \ and recommendations were made for the future development of DSTs in agro-ecosystems\
    \ across Europe."
