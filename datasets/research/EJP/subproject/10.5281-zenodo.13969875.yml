  abstract: "The internal EJP SOIL project SERENA contributed to the evaluation of\
    \ soil multifunctionality aiming at providing assessment tools for land planning\
    \ and soil policies at different scales. By co-working with relevant stakeholders,\
    \ the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks to assess\
    \ and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services\
    \ and their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,\
    \ at the regional, national, and European scales. \_\n\nThis data was prepared\
    \ according to the methodology of SERENA Soil Sealing cookbook. For Austria, the\
    \ application was carried out at regional scale. The map of soil sealing (soil\
    \ threat) was based on classification of multitemporal satellite images and photointerpretation.\
    \ The methodology uses vegetation and backscatter indices calculated over time\
    \ series of images, and decision rules. The semi-automatic classification supports\
    \ the subsequent photointerpretation phase based on national orthophotos and other\
    \ free VHR satellite images."
