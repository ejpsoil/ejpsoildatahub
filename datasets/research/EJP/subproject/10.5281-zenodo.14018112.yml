  abstract: "General description of SERENA\n\nThe internal EJP SOIL project SERENA\
    \ contributed to the evaluation of soil multifunctionality aiming at providing\
    \ assessment tools for land planning and soil policies at different scales. By\
    \ co-working with relevant stakeholders, the project provided co-developed indicators\
    \ and associated cookbooks to assess and map them, to report both on soil degradation,\
    \ soil-based ecosystem services and their bundles, under actual conditions and\
    \ for climate and land-use changes, at the regional, national, and European scales.\n\
