  abstract: "This data set belongs to a study on the soil microbial response to altered\
    \ temperature and moisture conditions, simulating scenarios relevant to the central-eastern\
    \ Po Valley, Italy.\n\nExperimental Design:\n\n\n\nTemperature: Two spring temperatures\
    \ were simulated: +2\xB0C and -2\xB0C relative to the average.\n\nMoisture: Prolonged\
    \ drought (20% of field capacity-FC), prolonged wet (above FC), and moderate drought\
    \ (50% FC) were tested.\n\nSoil: Loam-silty soil from a ploughed and an unploughed\
    \ field was used.\n\nMicrobes: Total fungi and the two main fungal phyla occurring\
    \ in top soil (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) were quantified, respectively, with\
    \ general and specific primers of the18S ribosomal RNA region using digital PCR.\
    \ Total \_bacteria were quantified with general primers of the 16S ribosomal RNA\
    \ region using Real-Time PCR.\_\n\n\nProcedure:\n\n\n\nWheat seedlings were grown\
    \ in pots for 15 days at 22\xB0C and 50% FC.\n\nTwo 60-day experimental periods\
    \ followed, with the designated temperature and moisture conditions.\n\nSoil samples\
    \ were collected from the rhizosphere of wheat plants at the end of each 60-day\
    \ cycle."
