  abstract: "The internal EJP SOIL project\_SERENA contributed to the evaluation of\
    \ soil multifunctionality aiming at providing assessment tools for land planning\
    \ and soil policies at different scales. By co-working with relevant\_stakeholders,\
    \ the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks to assess\
    \ and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services\
    \ and their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,\
    \ at\_the regional, national, and European scales.\n\nThe dataset corresponds\
    \ to a map of soil sealing of the Netherlands for the year 2022 (compared to 2021).\
    \ The map is the result of applying the Soil Sealing cookbook developed in SERENA/EJP-Soil.\
    \ It is based on multitemporal satellite images (a combination of Sentinel 1 &\
    \ 2 sattelite images). The methodology uses vegetation (Sentinel 1) and backscatter\
    \ (Sentinel 2) indices calculated over time series of images. The final map has\
    \ 10 m spatial resolution and is classified according to the following:\n\n1.\
    \ Possible changes identified by both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 methodologies\
    \ (very probable changes)2. Possible changes identified by Sentinel-1 methodology3.\
    \ Possible changes identified by Sentinel-2 methodology4. Possible changes identified\
    \ by Sentinel-2 methodology with shift period (less probable)"
