  abstract: "The internal EJP SOIL project\_SERENA contributed to the evaluation of\
    \ soil multifunctionality aiming at providing assessment tools for land planning\
    \ and soil policies at different scales. By co-working with relevant\_stakeholders,\
    \ the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks to assess\
    \ and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services\
    \ and their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,\
    \ at\_the regional, national, and European scales.\n\nPresent data was prepared\
    \ according to the methodology of SERENA Soil erosion and soil erosion control\
    \ cookbook for the territory of Hungary. The map of soil loss by water erosion\
    \ (soil threat) was based on the RUSLE model. To create the soil loss map we used\
    \ data on yearly precipitation of CARPATCLIM database, and AGRI4CAST MARS (R-factor);\
    \ sand-, silt-, and clay content of DOSoReMI.hu database, and SOC map compiled\
    \ in the framework of SERENA (K-factor); ESDAC LS-factor for the EU; ESDAC Cover\
    \ Management factor for the EU (C-factor); ESDAC Support Practices factor for\
    \ the EU (P-factor). For the soil erosion control, the difference between the\
    \ erosion map without vegetation (C-factor = 1) and the erosion map with vegetation\
    \ was calculated. The erosion maps with-, and without vegetation were categorized\
    \ according to the cookbook, and the result map shows how many categories the\
    \ pixel has changed when vegetation is taken into account (0: the pixel is in\
    \ the same category in both maps, 1: minor role of vegetation, 2: moderate role\
    \ of vegetation, 3: significant role of vegetation).\_"
