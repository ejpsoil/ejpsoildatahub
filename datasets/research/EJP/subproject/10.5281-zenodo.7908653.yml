  abstract: "<em>CONTEXT: </em>Cropland soil organic carbon (SOC) stock can be increased\
    \ by agricultural management, but is subject to various factors. The extent and\
    \ rates of SOC sequestration potential, as well as the controlling factors, under\
    \ different climate and management practices across a region or country are important\
    \ for policy-makers and land managers, however have been rarely known. <em>OBJECTIVE:\
    \ </em>We aim to investigate the extent and rates of SOC sequestration potential\
    \ over 2021-2040 under different scenarios of climate change and Sustainable Soil\
    \ Management (SSM) practices, and quantify the impacts of climate change and SSM\
    \ practices on the SOC sequestration potential, for croplands across Finland at\
    \ a spatial resolution of 1 km. <em>METHODS: </em>RothC model is run iteratively\
    \ to equilibrium to calculate the size of the SOC pools and the annual plant carbon\
    \ inputs. Then, it is applied to investigate the SOC sequestration potential over\
    \ 2021-2040 under different scenarios of climate change and SSM practices. Finally,\
    \ facorial simulation experiments are conducted to quantify the impacts of climate\
    \ change and SSM practices, alone and in combination, on SOC sequestration potential.\
    \ <em>RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: </em>Under the combined impacts of climate change\
    \ and SSM practices, the SOC sequestration potential during 2021-2040 relative\
    \ to 2020 will be on average -0.03, 0.007, 0.05, and 0.13 t C ha<sup>-1</sup>\
    \ yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, with carbon input being business as usual, 5%,\
    \ 10%, and 20% increase. This is equivalent to an annual change rate of -0.04%,\
    \ 0.009%, 0.07%, and 0.17%, respectively. Therefore, a 20% increase in C input\
    \ to soil will not be enough to obtain a 4\u2030 increase per year over the 20-year\
    \ period in Finland. Carbon input will promote SOC sequestration potential; however,\
    \ climate change will reduce it on average by 0.28 t C ha<sup>-1</sup>yr<sup>-1</sup>.\
    \ Across the cropland in Finland, on average, the relative contributions of C\
    \ input, temperature, and precipitation to SOC sequestration potential in 2021-2040\
    \ will be 56%, 24%, and 20%, respectively, however there is a spatially explicit\
    \ pattern. The SOC sequestration potential will be relatively high and dominated\
    \ by C input in west and southwest Finland. By contrast, it will be relatively\
    \ low and dominated by climate in north and east Finland, and the central part\
    \ of southern Finland. <em>SIGNIFICANCE: </em>Our findings provide the information\
    \ as to where, how much, and which SSM practices could be applied for enhancing\
    \ SOC sequestration at a high spatial resolution, which is essential for stakeholders\
    \ to increase cropland SOC sequestration efficiently."
