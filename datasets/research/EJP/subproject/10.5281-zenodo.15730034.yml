  abstract: 'This dataset contains selected farm structural information about the
    farms whose managers we interviewed as part of work package 4 ("Farmer-related
    challenges to the use of sustainable soil management practices") of the project
    SoilX ("Soil management to mitigate climate change-related precipitation eXtremes"),
    as well as the interviewees'' responses to questionnaire questions on soil management
    and "good farmer" norms. We interviewed farm managers from a total of five case
    study regions in Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Spain, and Sweden.


    The dataset is the basis for two different analyses: 1) A Q-methodological analysis
    across all case study regions, and 2) an analysis of farmers'' norms based on
    the concept of the "good farmer" across four of the case study regions (Austria,
    Switzerland, Spain, Sweden).


    The data are provided in an excel document with three sheets. Sheet 1 contains
    pseudonymized farm structural information (i.e., size classes instead of concise
    sizes; other potentially identifying information has been deleted) for all case
    study regions, sheet 2 contains responses to the questions on soil management
    again for all case study regions, and sheet 3 contains responses to questions
    on perceptions of a "good farmer" for all but the Danish case study region. Information
    that could lead to identification of individual interviewees has been removed
    and pseudonymized. This includes demographic information on farm managers and
    farm structural details, as well as information on biochar usage. Please also
    note the "notes" in each sheet concerning questionable or incomplete data. Interviewees
    are identified via country-specific IDs, where: AT = Austria, CH = Switzerland,
    DK = Denmark, ES = Spain, SE = Sweden.


    For the survey instrument (interview guideline and questionnaire) as well as the
    data from the Q-Methodological sorting please refer to the linked documents.'
