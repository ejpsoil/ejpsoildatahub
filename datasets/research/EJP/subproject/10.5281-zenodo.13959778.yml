  abstract: "The internal EJP SOIL project SERENA contributed to the evaluation of\
    \ soil multifunctionality aiming at providing assessment tools for land planning\
    \ and soil policies at different scales. By co-working with relevant stakeholders,\
    \ the project provided co-developed indicators and associated cookbooks to assess\
    \ and map them, to report both on soil degradation, soil-based ecosystem services\
    \ and their bundles, under actual conditions and for climate and land-use changes,\
    \ at the regional, national, and European scales. \_ \_ \_ \_\n\nThis dataset\
    \ is based on the evaluation of Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP), a critical measure\
    \ of carbon dynamics and ecosystem health reflecting the balance between gross\
    \ primary productivity and total ecosystem respiration. Data were gathered for\
    \ the SERENA GHG Cookbook application and include: Gross Primary Productivity\
    \ (GPP) data from the 2014 MODIS dataset accessed via MODISTools in R, daily soil\
    \ moisture data from Zhang et al. (2023), climate data comprising maximum and\
    \ minimum monthly temperatures for 2014 from World Climate datasets, cropland\
    \ data filtered for wheat from 2018 obtained from Sentinel-1 and LUCAS observations,\
    \ and municipal boundaries sourced as vector data from the Republic of Estonia\
    \ Land Board's Geoportal. \_\n\nThe analysis focuses on NEP in the Peipsi\xE4\xE4\
    re municipality under North European pedo-climatic conditions during the active\
    \ growing season. The dataset comprises two files: one representing the 8-day\
    \ NEP in wheat fields of the Peipsi\xE4\xE4re municipality (measured in gC m-2\
    \ for an 8-day period) and the other indicating the NEP in wheat fields during\
    \ May (measured in gC m-2 during May). These files are titled SERENA_EJPSOIL_EE_GHG\
    \ Cookbook_NEP_April8days_wheat_yields and SERENA_EJPSOIL_EE_GHG Cookbook_NEP_May_wheat_yield,\
    \ respectively, and are both formatted in GPKG.\n\n\_"
