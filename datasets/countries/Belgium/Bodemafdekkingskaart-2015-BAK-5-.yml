  title: Land cover map in Flanders, 5m resolution, 2015
  abstract: Geographic raster dataset showing the land cover in Flanders, status 2015. This map has a focus on the soil and the loss of its essential ecosystem functions as soil and the irreversibility thereof. We speak here of 'Soil cover'. Soil sealing is expressed as the area where the nature and/or condition of the soil surface has been changed by the application of artificial, (semi-) impermeable materials, resulting in the loss of essential ecosystem functions of the soil. The map is displayed in percentage coverage per pixel (5m resolution).
