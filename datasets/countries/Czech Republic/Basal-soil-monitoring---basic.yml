  title: Monitoring of agricultural soils in the Czech Republic
  abstract: "Arable land samples are taken from topsoil (according to the thickness\
    \ of the horizon, maximum up to 25 cm) and subsoil (35\u201360 cm), in orchards\
    \ and vineyards also from two horizons (0\u201330 cm, 30\u201360 cm), on hop fields\
    \ from topsoil (10\u201340 cm) and subsoil (40\u201370 cm); for permanent grassland\
    \ from three layers (0\u201310 cm, 10\u201325 cm, 25\u201340 cm; always after\
    \ removing the upper sod layer)                                              \
    \                  For organic pollutants only topsoil horizon, for mineral nitrogen\
    \ - topsoil and subsoil  "
